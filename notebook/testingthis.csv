May pro MMA experience din kaya si Batista noong 2012 with a TKO win via ground and pound. I don't think Pacquiao can survive a full mount barrage against Batista üòÜ

At wut panong nakansel si Pacquiao eh meron pa rin naman syang malaking following, may platform at di nawala ang status nya bilang boxing legend. Baka sabihin mo pang nakansel sya ng mga sponsors nya eh private businesses yun na iniisip lang ay ang reputation ng brand nila. Iba kasi ang pagpupuna at pagkkansel. Sa pagpuna kay pacquiao, nanghihingi tayo ng accountability sa isang public official, na ideally, ang best interest ng kanyang pinaglilinkuran ang nasa isip.

If the church (religion) would not like to recognize same-sex marriage, then kahit man lang sa batas ma-recognize sila. Para magkaroon din ng rights ang mga homosexual relationship tulad ng rights na mayroon ang mga hetero. Isa na lang din diyan pagdating sa conjugal property. Maganda rin na mabigyan sila ng rights and recognition na makapag-ampon.
Medyo malayo sa question pero maganda rin na sana ma-reinforce ang sex education with family planning sa bansa.

What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Mr. Atienza, you are an elected official. Save us the platitudes and get on to your job which is policy making. Let's get factual, shall we?
Kung pamayanan ang usapan, ang pamilya ang pinakabasic na unit. Basically, always, ALWAYS treated na default ang pamilya sa mga bagay bagay patungkol sa isang tao. Ano ibig kong sabihin dito?

Kapag kapakanan ng bata ang usapan, magulang ang unang unang dapat na nakikialam at responsable
Kapag may isang taong pumanaw na walang naisusulat na huling habilin, pamilya yung legal na tagapagmana.
Kapag ang isang lalakeng pamilyado eh nag-isip na gusto kong magbuhay binata ulit, karapatan ng asawang babae na maghabol ng sustento para sa mga anak. At karapatan ng asawa na magsampa ng demanda laban sa nangangaliwang asawa.
Ang isang senior citizen na pensionado ng SSS, kapag siya ay pumanaw ay makakatanggap pa din ng benepisyo ang naulilang asawa (unless mag-asawa siya ulit)

HIndi po isinusulong ng mga pro-same sex marriage ang more rights, they are just asking for equal. Pantay na proteksyon sa ilalim ng batas. Hindi naman mawawasak ang pamilya mo pag ang LGBT eh malaya nang ikasal sa kung kanino nila gusto. (Kasi pag nawasak yung pamilya mo, that's on you, not them).
Bakit nga ba isyu ito ng equal rights? Kasi una sa lahat, walang sinoman ang kayang pagbawalan kang mahalin ang taong mahal mo. Pangalawa, maliban na lang sa pakikiapid sa taong may asawa na, hindi bawal sumama sa iba pang tao na kagaya mo. Walang batas na nagdidikta kung sino lang ang pwede mong mahalin. Pwede kang ikasal sa taong kababata mo, pwede kang ikasal sa nakilala mo na matanda ka na, pwede kang ikasal sa foreigner. Kung umibig ka man sa taong kaparehas mo ng kasarian, hindi naman sex lang ang nakasama sa isang relasyon. Pag mahal mo ang isang tao, it is friendship and more. At pag ikinasal ka sa kanya, sinasabi mo sa harap ng madla na mahal ko ang taong ito at tatanda akong kasama siya. Maaari kaming mag-anak, maaari ding hindi, pero siya ang pinili kong maging pamilya ko. Siya ang mundo ko, may anak man o wala.
That, Mr. Congressman, is what you are saying no to. This isn't a topic of what goes to which hole, or whether or not you like it or if you're disgusted by it. Standing by your own words makes it look like pinakasalan mo lang ang asawa mo para anakan.",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Palagay kapag na re-brand ito na same sex union or legal partnership, posibleng magkaroon sa Pilipinas. It is all about the word ""marriage"", nakakabit talaga sya sa relihiyon. Kaya wag na ipilit, baguhin na lang ang tawag tapos yun ang i-lobby.",1

What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,Yes to same sex marriage! Kailangang magkaroon din ng kapantay na recognition ang same sex couples upang makamit nila ang pantay at sapat na serbisyo ng gobyerno.,1

What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Same sex marriage is fine. Ang importante mahal nila ang isa't isa. Kasalanan ba nila na yun ang napusuan nila  di naman sila pumatay or something. Kala mo naman sakit yung SSM na nakakahawa, yung maiinfect mga straight. Lol.
As for divorce (kasi yung thread madaming ganitong topic) , kailangan to sa Pilipinas. Sorry pero bobo ba yung mga law makers natin? Dami dami nga jan na nagkakabitan lang. Mga palabas nga sa tv puro yun ang topic. Kasi yun ang sitwasyon ng pinas. Parang tinutulungan lang nila yung mga gago na cheaters para ipagpatuloy ang katarantaduhan nila. Parang kulang na lang sabihin nila na ""eh ano kung lokohin kita? Di mo ko maiiwan kasi kasal tayo"" saka kelangan lang ng konting push yung pagsasabatas ng divorce. Madaming pabor jan. Mga pabebe lang pero pag naapprove naman as legal eh mga ligayang ligaya.",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Siguro mas maganda unahin ang civil union. Ang pinaka pinag lalaban naman kasi dito is hindi lamang yung marriage it self eh, bagkus yung rights ng pagiging mag asawa lalo na sa pamahalaan. marami kasing mga bagay na inaallow lng sa mga mag asawa na kinikilala ng estado. katulad nalang ng mga property, desicions, insurrance atbp.
katulad nung isang couple na lalaki, sobrang tagal na nila magkasama. yung partner biglang ng life and death situation (commatose) na kailangan ng consent ng pamilya para gawin ung procedure, kaso ang nasa tabi at kasama nya lang yung partner nya kaso hndi hinahayaang mag desisyon sya dahil hi di naman sila legal na mag partner. Yung pamilya nung na comma is nasa ibang bansa na lahat. so yung mga gantong situation ang pinag lalaban ng civil union.
Kung hindi pa kaya ng mga relihiyon ang pag tanggap sa ganto, sana man lang mismong gobyerno kilalanin at bigyan sila ng karapatan dahil ang habol nila is legal rights sa isat isa.",1

When we learn to love - we learn to understand and accept. Masyado ng magulo mundo natin para pigilan tayo sa mga bagay na nagpapasaya satin. Ayusin ang batas kung kinakailangan para magkaroon ng grounds for same sex marriage.,1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,Para sa akin ay naninniwala ako sa same sex marriage dahil lahat ng tao ay may karapatan na magmahalan kahit pa man ito ay sa kasalan at sobrang mainip ang pagtingin ng maraming Pilipino sa mga homosexuals at sa gay marriage issue dahil sa Relihiyon. Para sa akin y masyado na na naging makapangyarihan sa impluwensiya at politika ng simbahan kumpara dati dahil parang one sided sila sa mga issue at puro sila anti duterte at anti marcos at pati nga mga pari tumatakbo na sa eleksiyon at lalong lalo na si Pacquiao at kung sino ang simbolo nito ng nakakabwiset na ideya ng religous influence sa politika sa pinas ay si pacquiao na pagnapili syang pangulo aynako na nangyari sa bansa natin kaya kailangan na ng total separation of church and state sa Pilipinas dahil nagiging one sided na ang politika sa Pilipinas dahil sa impluwensiyang ito na nagiging authoritarian na ang polisiya sa pagbibigay ng ekwalidad para sa mga taong naghahangad ng karapatang maikasal at magmahalan sa kanilang sariling kagustuhan na sa ating natural na batas sa lahat ay pagiging ekwal at magmahalan pero sa status ng bansa natin malubha na ito ay maisagawa  dahil sa pagiging one sided na ng mga politiko na nangangampanya lang base sa relihiyon at hindi sa karapatan ng tao tulad ni Pacqiao at Sotto pero kung ako ang tatanungin mo pipiliin ko si sotto imbis si pacqiao,1

What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,Oh gay,1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"my stand in marriage is;
it is a union for any gender‚Äôs or any sexuality‚Äôs form of love.
ang important naman is hindi nakaka-abala sa lipunan in a harmful way. 
marami naman kasi masasabi ang lipunan eh, pero madalas, hindi nakakabuti or wala namang maiaambag sa pamumuhay mo.
let them be. (the same-sex couples in accordance with the topic)
kasi if the concern naman is sexual intercourse for reproduction, nature na iyan. Dadami at dadami parin naman ang tao.
However, due to my experience as part of the GenZ and through some millennial‚Äôs testimony, lipunan din ang nagpabago sa mindset nila kaya marami ang ayaw nang magka-anak, for the betterment of their children not knowing the world na kinagisnan nilang mamulat sa mapanghusga at punong-puno ng pait na mundo.
Climate Change.
Economic Crisis.
Generational Trauma.
Extinction of Wildlife (or other type of animals)
Plains and forests turning into subdivisions, hotels, resorts.
Balding Mountains.
‚ÄòPoor‚Äô Education System.

What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Honestly, I believe that religion must always have a connection to politics. Because religion guides us to establish actions and decisions morally, if it's right or wrong. For example, someone wants to create a law. The 10 commandments in Christianity stated that no one shall harm others. Hence, that will be their basis if that law can harm anyone. If there is someone that will be harmed by this law, then it must be rejected.
Kaya I don't agree on this na dapat hiwalay ang religion and politics. But I believe na dapat may boundaries 'to kasi may mga times na nakikisali ang some members ng church like the opportunist priests na gagawin ang lahat para sa kanila lang mapunta ang benefits. They preach about the Bible yet hindi naman nila isinasabuhay. Parang panahon ng Kastila lang ang vibes. Hindi sila mga totoong tagasunod ng Diyos dahil ginagamit lang nila ang name of God para maka angat.
P.S. Hindi ko nilalahat ang mga pari. There are some na hangang-hanga talaga ako dahil sa pagiging virtuous nila. Sila talaga ang mga totoong kapanalig ng Diyos.",1

What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Icopy paste ko nalang para mabasa mo lol. Reply ko doon sa nagreply sayo. Hindi kita inaaway ah. Baka kasi hindi ka pa fully informed or tamad ka lang magresearch since hindi ka siguro directly affected (meaning you or your loved ones wont ever need abortion, or can afford one when the time comes). Kasi decriminalizing abortion is for the poor women. Wealthy women do it all the time whether legalized or not. Ang kawawa kasi dito yung mga walang kakayanan.
Wait. Paki dagdag na rin. Ibig sabihin ba kapag ang babae narape doon lang siya pwede magpa abort? Does it mean, someone has to violate her body muna before she can decide for her own?
Also! Corpses or brain dead ppl are protected by law na bawal galawin katawan nila. So mas may body autonomy pa ang patay kaysa sa buhay na babae.
Also!!!! Kung ""ikaw gumawa yan panindigan mo"" ibig sabihin ba mga bata ay form of punishment lang? By that sense, pangit na kaagad. Kaya nabubuhay tayo sa society na lagi sinusumbat sa mga anak na hindi sila pinalaglag. Lol.
Also also also last na!!! Kung papairalin yung logic ulit na ""ikaw may kasalanan, ikaw magbayad"". Ibig sabihin ba yung mga naaksidente dahil sa drunk driving (sabihin natin yung may kasalanan na drunk driver same na same sila ng blood type nung nabiktima niya) at kunwari dahil sa aksidente nawalan siya ng paa ibig sabihin ba nun by all force kukunin yung paa nung drunk driver since siya naman may kasalanan? So ibig sabihin mas may bodily autonomy pa ang isang kriminal kaysa sa mga babae.
Also. Dont pls use the ""ipa-adopt"" card. Overflowing na ang orphans. Plus majority of the orphaned girls are raped. Cycle repeats bec of their inaccessibility to safe abortion.
Isipin niyo nalang pls. Tsaka magresearch kayo. Normal ang abortion before colonization. Pinapairal lang yan dati kasi the more slaves, the more maganda yung work force and beneficial sa mga slave owners. Free country na tayo lol. Very medieval ang pagcriminalize sa abortion.",1

What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Wait. Paki dagdag na rin. Ibig sabihin ba kapag ang babae narape doon lang siya pwede magpa abort? Does it mean, someone has to violate her body muna before she can decide for her own?
Also! Corpses or brain dead ppl are protected by law na bawal galawin katawan nila. So mas may body autonomy pa ang patay kaysa sa buhay na babae.
Also!!!! Kung ""ikaw gumawa yan panindigan mo"" ibig sabihin ba mga bata ay form of punishment lang? By that sense, pangit na kaagad. Kaya nabubuhay tayo sa society na lagi sinusumbat sa mga anak na hindi sila pinalaglag. Lol.
Also also also last na!!! Kung papairalin yung logic ulit na ""ikaw may kasalanan, ikaw magbayad"". Ibig sabihin ba yung mga naaksidente dahil sa drunk driving (sabihin natin yung may kasalanan na drunk driver same na same sila ng blood type nung nabiktima niya) at kunwari dahil sa aksidente nawalan siya ng paa ibig sabihin ba nun by all force kukunin yung paa nung drunk driver since siya naman may kasalanan? So ibig sabihin mas may bodily autonomy pa ang isang kriminal kaysa sa mga babae.

What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Hello, I have been reading some of the replies here and I've also noticed that the issue of the majority being against to contraceptives in sex is also being discussed here. I do not intend to offend anyone. But I just want to ask these questions so that we can be enlightened about the different sides of the issue.
In the first place, bakit pa nagse-sex ang mga tao kung alam naman nila mismo sa sarili nila ang mga consequences? May nabasa ako kanina and I agree with them; sex is a choice hindi naman iyan sobrang daling gawin na parang isang sanggi mo lang may nangyari na. There is more into that, there is so much to prepare, bago pa mapasok ang isa sa ano, may malaki kang free will kung itutuloy mo. If you understand me, alam mong ibig kong sabihin na everything about sex requires free will. They have the power to stop. 
And I am surprised nang may mabasa ako dito sa thread na ito kung saan sinabi niya na pampahaba lang ng proseso ang kasal para lang makapag-sex. So, you do not consider sex as a big decision, a sacred decision? Because I believe that sex is not supposed to be like a game. Gagawin mo lang kasi gusto mo, kasi masarap? Don't get me wrong, I also believe that sex is a part of the normal function of a human body. But I do not consider it ‚Äúhobby.‚Äù
Kasal is something like basbas sa relasyon, hindi lang basta-basta pampahaba ng proseso para lang makapag-sex ang dalawang tao. It is a ceremony to create the promise, the commitment para mahalin mo ang isang tao nang buo. Aalagaan mo siya, magiging responsable ka kasi iisa na kayo. At dahil iisa na kayo, doon na pumapasok ang sex because of your fervent love. Again, I believe that sex is not supposed to be a hobby.
Iyon ang aking stand here. I hope someone would answer these questions and provide their own stand in this. I assure you that I will try my best to be respectful as I can. I am also trying to establish din ng mga discussions.",1

One of the reasons kung bakit di pa ready ang mga pinoy sa progress ay dahil karamihan satin malakas parin kapot sa tradition ng culture natin. Majority ng progress na kinakailangan ng mga pilipino ay kabaliktaran ng traditions natin.

What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"May iba alam nila ang consequences pero hindi sila ""ready"" to accept the responsibility. Ginagawa nila because of various reasons. One of which is pleasure , prolly 2nd , they are curious (and so much more possible answers). Up until today madaming kabit,kirida,concubine you get the idea. They know the consequences and yet they are doing it. You may wonder why? Siguro bored sila sa asawa nila. Who knows? Life isn't always plain black and white.  
‚Äì Thank you for clearing this up. I don't understand kasi noong una kung bakit nagse-sex ang dalawang tao even though they have the power to prevent it.
And yet we have a lot of cases of premarital sex and abortion. Merong free-will yes, choice nila, pero usually yung reason ""nagkamali"". We cannot really undo what we've already done.  
‚Äì Maybe because of not enough sex education. Gaya ng sabi mo kanina, maraming curious kaya nila ginagawa. Tapos minsan kapag wala sa sarili (ex. 'pag lasing), nagkakamali sila. 
Noong una kasi, yung perspective ko ay nasa mga taong nag-eenjoy kahit may kakayahan namang magpigil at alam naman ang consequences tapos mamomroblema kapag nabuntis. 
Why is sex a ""sacred decision""? Sacred to you probably because of your religion. And according to what? To your beliefs?  
Akin lang, buhay nila yan. Kung ano man ang gawin nila sa buhay nila, responsibility nila. Ang may pwede lang bumatikos sa parties involved ay yung taong related sa parties na involved. Kung ""game"" para sa kanila then let them. Kung may talo sa ""game"", can we really do anything about it? The only thing that I know of that we can do is to condemn the abuser on the internet (since social media is a powerful tool). Worse kung teenagers pa lang, but if they are rich, at the very least they can finance to support themselves if there is an unwanted pregnancy. In regards sa same sex-marriage, basta walang tinatapakan. Same with any other relationships.
‚Äì What I mean in sacred decsion is that sex is very important to consider. Hindi siya gagawin mo lang kung gusto mo. Na kapag inatake ka ng lust mo, gagawin na.
On the other hand, I fully agree and support Same-Sex Marriage din. 'Yun din kasi ang iniisip ko. Kung wala namang nasasaktan (ethical), why not? Kung makakatulong sa pagpapaunlad ng buhay ng dalawang tao, why not? 
Sabi nga sa Bible, wag kang gagawa ng masama sa kapwa mo. ‚ÄúLove Thy Neighbor.‚Äù So for me, it should be acceptable in our religion. I don't get the reasoning na ipinagbabawal ng Diyos 'to. Religion should not be the problem in this Same-Sex Marriage kasi sa una pa lang wala naman itong problema sa kanila. Yung iba't ibang interpretation lang talaga ang naghi-hinder dito.

And besides, as someone who grew up from a poor family buo na yung loob ko na di ako mag aanak unless sigurado ako na pag tumanda ako at napag -aral ko yung anak ko eh di ako aasa sa kanya. Ang anak eh hindi insurance at hindi caregiver. Sorry na kung magulo yung explain ko hahahaha.",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Kaloka no? XDDD. I mean.... Minsan iniisip ko, ano ba talaga yung purpose ng religion sa buhay nila? I often ask myself about this. Kaya nga I'm not into religion kase I'm not practicing my faith anyways. I respect religions and beliefs to a certain degree pero yung tipong i coconvert nila ako, ay nako, try me.
Ano ba yung INC? Muslim ba sila or kinuha lang nila yung concept ng Islam about sa Halal tas christianity yung base ng religion kase ito yung faith ng majority ng population? Ganito para mas madami silang donations XDDD?",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"At least nagiiba na yung thinking ng generation ngayon. At ""nawawala"" na yung old culture pakonti konti :D. Ang hirap ng life noon (1950s).... lalo na ngayon (2022)!",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"INC parang Christian protestant wala pa naman sila sa level ng Kosher or Halal, blood and alcohol lang bawal sa kanila.
&#x200B;
Speaking of Islam and religion nung nasa isang business trip ako sa SG there are like 2 guys from Saudi Arabia, nung nag ka labasan na ng Alak ayun sabi hindi daw sila na inom dahil bawal daw sa religion nila pero titikim lang daw ng gin at Beer.
&#x200B;
Pucha yung tikim nila bote bote at lahat ata sinubukan, tapos nung medyo malasing na nag tanong saakin yung isa ""Why do you think religions like Islam thinks Alcohol is bad I think its cool!"" 
&#x200B;
Tamang tama pagka tanong niya nun sumuka na yung isang kasama niya
Kaya sabi ko.. ""Well its frowned upon by some religions because of that..""",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Pag ganyan sinasabi ko wala na ako oaki sa katawan ko e patay na ako. Pero TBH, sana malegalise din ang assisted suicide para yung mga tao na after 60+ may choice not to die senile... And of course para sa mga taong may terminal illnesses na ayaw na nila mag suffer.",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"INC parang Christian protestant wala pa naman sila sa level ng Kosher or Halal, blood and alcohol lang bawal sa kanila.

> Alcohol and baboy bawal sa Halal. Parang gaya gaya lang naman sila XDDD. 
&#x200B;
Pucha yung tikim nila bote bote at lahat ata sinubukan, tapos nung medyo malasing na nag tanong saakin yung isa ""Why do you think religions like Islam thinks Alcohol is bad I think its cool!""
> Siryoso? I worked in SG for a time, strict yung manager ko sa pork products, yung tipong parang papatay sila pag nakakain sila ng any pork products. I don't really believe that much in religion kase by nature, humans..... curious tayo na mag explore ng iba't ibang bagay. The more na bawal or forbidden, mas masarap AHAHAHAHA!
&#x200B;
Basta ayaw ko sa religion kase minsan yung mga fanatics.... sila din yung gumagawa ng way para maging ""acceptable"" yung bawal. Sa middle east merong documentary dun about sex. Bawal makipag sex yung lalaki kapag hindi kasal sa babae. Pero according sa ""holy book"" nila, bawal sa babae pero walang sinabi about m2m relationship. So....... a lot of them are having sex to a younger male. So in that sense, napaka extreme nila sa religion pero sila din tong sumisira ng rules. Bullshit if you will ask me. Sorry kung may natamaan ako about religion XD!",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"I did. High school. Catholic school yung school namin e so merong ""bible reading"". Saka ang hirap ng pinapagawa mo na ""read bible without thinking religion LEL!",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Medyo tricky yung subject. Parang debate lang noong HS ako about Euthanasia. Pro ba or anti. Japan for instance.... madaming suicides because of bullying or pressure sa society. Kung ilelegalize, malaking controversy esp. human rights etc.",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Yeah yan mahirap sa abrahamic faiths homophobic and naturally mysoginistic.
Yung tipo pag na bastos yung babae eh deserved naman daw kasi maikli shorts.
Like WTF?
Parang yung mga comment ni Pakyaw dati about gays.",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Sa amin, walang bible reading. Yung imbyerna sa amin yung October na araw araw kami pinagdarasal ng buong rosary üòÇüòÇüòÇ",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Kaloka no? XD. So yung lalaki pwedeng nakahubad na tops pero yung babae bawal magsuot ng shorts. So asan dun yung control ng libido ng males? So ang nangyari in favor palagi sa males kase ang nag cocompromise females. In that sense, yung freedom nila compromised na, freedom pa lang yan sa damit ha XDDD. So equality is not really their agenda but to assert control bit by bit. Siguro pwedeng hubad hubad pero walang touch touch, hanggang tingin lang dapat :DDD! Afterall ginusto naman siguro ng babae magsuot ng shorts so merong consequences pero bottomline, wala dapat parang rape or hindi dapat siya gagalawin.  
Iniisip nila kung ano yung mas advantageous sa kanila.",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Basta ako I don't like religion. I respect it pero hanggang diyan lang. Jusko! Meron sa school namin yung may month na mag rorosary talaga. I forgot. Semana Santa ba? AHAHAHA di ko alam. Basta may religious occassion, guess what, halos lahat ng klase nakakatulog. Tas mag paulit ulit yung prayer 5 times dahil sa 5 mysteries ba yun kase yun yung rosary right? OMG Hindi ko alam! Perfect ko to dati kase ang requirement lang naman dito is memorization na kailngan ipasa dahil sa subject :DDDD!",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"Yup ang labo ng rational nila, its one thing to think and judge that some one's clothes are inapropriate but to jump the gun that they deserved to get raped? 
I mean kahit pa nga naka hubo na sumakay sa MRT yung girl wala sila karapatan pag salitaan yun at bastusin let alone rape.
Caveman mentality masyadong feeling matcho ang babansot naman.",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,"IMHO, dapat hindi na antayin ang veggie state. Yung kapag capable pa magdecision ang tao pwede nang tanungin if magpapa life support pa ba or what or get some lethal injections to pass on quietly and peacefully. That for me is ideal para di na magsuffer yung family sa expenses and di ma prolong suffering ko.",1
What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,Take note Religion teacher pa yun ha (yung nagsabing kasalanan ng female magbihis ng inappropriate at narape)! XDDD,1
Terrorist Attack Right now in Marawi,,"As per the mayor of Marawi via CNN Philippines, there is no current Philippine troops in Marawi city. 
He is inside the city hall and vowed to defend the city hall.",1
Terrorist Attack Right now in Marawi,,Will this be another Zamboanga? Tangina nga Mauten group,1
Terrorist Attack Right now in Marawi,,"I;m gonna rant...
Matagal na nangyayari ito sa Marawi noong wala pang ang ISIS, lalo na sa MSU marawi mismo. NOTE: Likely connected ang mga terrorist group at mga criminal groups sa ARMM. (Off-topic: Eto ang problema ko sa talks with MILF, kasi alam ng lahat na mga locals na takbuhan ng mga kriminal ang mga kampo nila). Kaya natatawa ako sa mga umiiyak sa ginagawa ni Duterte. Parang ngayon lang nila nalaman kung gaano kalala ang nangyayaring karahasan sa Pilipinas, which is and still happening bago pa naging presidente si Duterte (Ang mali lang ngayon eh nakisali na ang gobyerno mismo).
Matagal na walang action ang gobyerno against sa mga corrupt feudal drug lords sa ARMM. Kaya thumbs down ako kay Duterte kasi wala siyang action tungkol sa situation ng ARMM. Mukhang plano niyang i-isolate ang ARMM, lalo na kung matuloy ang federal government (meaning bahala na sila). In-appoint ni GMA si retired police general Ricardo De Leon as university president para magkaroon ng order in-campus. Pero anong nangyari? Yung mga alumni at professors(that belong to certain religious/indigenous group, you know) cried martial law. Certainly nakinabang sila at relatives nila sa corruption na nagyayari in-campus kaya nag reklamo sila. Basically, as long as makinabang sila, wala silang pakialam sa nangyayaring criminalities in-campus. Kaya ayon nag resign si De Leon after few years at bumalik naman sa dating gawi ang mga kriminal.
Matagal na to na nangyayari, so don't act so shocked. Also if the illegal setlers that belong to certain religious/indigenous group do not like their neighbors or want to widen their landspace, they will likely burn their neighbor's house. NOTE: These illegal settlers are likely related to a campus official(president, vp, etc) and professors. Wala silang pakialam.",1

O sige para hindi masyadong burgis pakinggan, sige, ugaling magbigay ng due respect even to strangers. Kaya nagfu-function society natin kasi hindi lahat tayo kupal (gaya mo).
O bago mo ako i-bash, eto comment ko sa ganap. I think strategic location ang Pilipinas para puntahan ng ISIS. May access sa mga nearby muslim countries, plus sa mga US military bases na nakatayo nearby. O diba. Kaya magibg extra vigilant tayo mga pre. O kung ano mang safety precaution you deem fit.

AND you're taking out my definition of kupal from its context by giving a very different example. You'd, instead of resolving differences, rather put people down by pushing onto them your own definition of what's right. That's right. You're self-righteous. Oh ibalik natin sa ginawa mo kanina ha? Compare natin sa escalator example mo. Oh may requirement bang nakalagay dito na dapat ""insightful"" ang mga replies more than 100 characters? Which btw, overlooks the other characteristic of the word insightful. Minsan nagiging insightful ang paragraph dahil sa sarili mong realizations by connecting the dots. Nagawa mo ba iyon? Upset ka kasi di ka nakakuha ng insight sa post niya? Kasalanan pa ba niya iyon? Lol. 
Don't us nga, beh. Naghahanap ka ng away in the face of terrorism. Dapat nga we're standing together. Oh see. Isa eto sa mga example how to resolve disagreements. By tolerating the kupals around you.

Una sa lahat, isang magpalayang International Women's Day sa lahat. Mabuhay ang kababaihan!

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

To get to know more about me, here is my [one page profile](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1499242488745570305) and [overview of my platform](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1485099222928338946).

"I am Luke Espiritu - labor organizer, lawyer, and activist, now running for Senator under Partido Lakas ng Masa. Ask me anything!","Edit:

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

Medyo dismayado lang po ako kasi halos wala kong nakitang tumakbo na nagsama sa platform nila neto.
Possible o Magagawan po ba ng paraan ung mga government offices na essential sa mga manggagawa like (philhealth, sss, pagibig, dole, bir, nso, nbi etc.) Na habaan ng shift o kaya lagyan ng night shift?
Sa dami naman ng benefits at bonus ng mga yan impossible di mangyare. 
Dinaig pa sila ng call centre natin na 24 hours na ang serbisyo 
Business hours lang sila meron pag uwi ng manggagawa sarado na, kailan pa mag leave or di kaya umabsent para mahabol ang requirements or loans.
Di naman po makatao na kailangan pa matulog ng gabi sa labas at sa tabi ng kalsada para lang mauna sa pila dahil meron lang silang 100 or 200 na tao na tinatanggap sa araw na iyon.
(Alam kong may covid pero pre pandemic ganyan parin naman sila)
Itong administrasyon natin naglabas pangulo natin ng hotline, para pag hindi nasunod ung deadline eh isusumbong duon sa hotline.
Medyo panget na galawan po un at tamad kung iisipin. imbes na baguhin at paunlarin ang systema ng bumilis eh lalo pinipressure at tinatakot pa ang manggagawa.
Salamat po ulit Atty. Luke
naway paunlakan niyo po ang tanong ko.
Kasama na po kayo sa boto ko netong darating na election. ‚úä",1

It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

Una sa lahat, isang magpalayang International Women's Day sa lahat. Mabuhay ang kababaihan!

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

To get to know more about me, here is my [one page profile](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1499242488745570305) and [overview of my platform](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1485099222928338946).

"I am Luke Espiritu - labor organizer, lawyer, and activist, now running for Senator under Partido Lakas ng Masa. Ask me anything!","Edit:

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

To get to know more about me, here is my [one page profile](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1499242488745570305) and [overview of my platform](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1485099222928338946).

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

Una sa lahat, isang magpalayang International Women's Day sa lahat. Mabuhay ang kababaihan!

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

To get to know more about me, here is my [one page profile](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1499242488745570305) and [overview of my platform](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1485099222928338946).

"I am Luke Espiritu - labor organizer, lawyer, and activist, now running for Senator under Partido Lakas ng Masa. Ask me anything!","Edit:

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

To get to know more about me, here is my [one page profile](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1499242488745570305) and [overview of my platform](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1485099222928338946).

"I am Luke Espiritu - labor organizer, lawyer, and activist, now running for Senator under Partido Lakas ng Masa. Ask me anything!","Edit:

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

To get to know more about me, here is my [one page profile](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1499242488745570305) and [overview of my platform](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1485099222928338946).

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

Kailangan na natin ng tunay na alternatibo sa trapong pulitika na napakatagal na sumasakal sa manggagawa at masa. 
Habang tumataas ang presyo ng bilihin, nagsta-stagnate ang wages ng manggagawa, sinusupil ang karapatan mag-organisa, at lumalala ang climate crisis ay mas yumayaman ang mga malalaking kapitalista at tuloy-tuloy pa rin ang political circus sa bansa natin, imbis na nagbibigay ng tunay na solusyon.
Not only do we need to put these issues to the forefront but also show that hindi natin kailangan bumuntot sa maduming pulitika ng mga trapo.

It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

To get to know more about me, here is my [one page profile](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1499242488745570305) and [overview of my platform](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1485099222928338946).

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

A few days ago, this sub is full of posts about people no longer wanting to help out during calamities and the likes. Kasi nga the government should be doing its work, and hindi na dapat sinasalo ng ordinaryong Pilipino ang responsibilidad.
Pero ngayon, dahil NGO na ang Angat Buhay, marami na ulit gusto mag volunteer. Hindi daw mamimili ng tutulungan. So pag may sakuna at palpak ang gobyerno sa response, NGOs like Angat Buhay will step up to help.
Akala ko ba ang gusto natin eh maipa-mukha sa taong bayan kung gano ka-incompetent ng gobyernong ibinoto nila? Papano mangyayari yun kung laging sasaluhin ang kapalpakan ng gobyerno?
They already hate Leni. Despite all the initiatives she did during the pandemic, her presence during calamities, etc. they believed she didn‚Äôt do anything the last 6 years as VP. You think this NGO will improve their views on her?
May mga nakita na ko na nagsasabing ‚Äúpampabango‚Äù niya lang daw yan for the next elections. They‚Äôll probably grab credits for whatever the NGO accomplishes.
Combatting misinformation is a must, but the question is how? Why weren‚Äôt we successful during the campaign period? What difference are we going to do now? House to house didn‚Äôt work. Tiktok videos didn‚Äôt work either. So how are we gonna combat it? Isa pa, people are not gonna buy it kasi they see us as biased against Marcos, which is true. They see Marcos as the victim of slander, so whatever fact-checking we do is not gonna be effective kasi sa tingin nila eh biased tayo.

"Wait, why are you guys moving in?",,"Let me tell you a story.
About two years ago, I visited my lola in California. During that trip, nagdevelop ako nag pigsa at lumala. It got worse enough na kailangan na ako dalin sa emergency room (during my last night). Nilagay ako sa CAT scan, binigyan ng pampatulog, at drain yun mga nana na nasa binti ko. Gusto nga ng mga doctor dun na mag admit pa ako sa hospital (sa US) for ten days, as life threatening yun sugat ko. From hearing all those horror stories about getting a five-digit bill (in dollars), I decided to just risk it. Go back to my lola's house, pack my shit, and take the flight home.
As soon as I got off NAIA, diretso na agad ako sa hospital sa Bulacan. Nag stay ako ng one week (may aircon yun room) dun. Sinaksakan ako ng anti-biotics, kung meron pa, drain nila yun naititrang pigsa, linisin, at gamotin yun sugat ko.
Lahat lahat (gamot, kwarto, doctor. procedure), 100K lang binayaran. (around $2,000). One week later, dumating yun bill ko sa hospital sa US, at $18,000 (almost 1m sa atin) ang singil sa akin, just at the emergency room. If I were to stay in the hospital in the US, baka umabot pa ng $100,000 (5 million sa atin).",1
"Wait, why are you guys moving in?",,"So did you have to pay for it? Ano ang rules pag na- ER and visitor, winawaive ba nila pag wala na doon?
I always recommend getting travel insurance pag umaalis ng bansa. Case in point: Binayaran nila lahat surgery pati recovery ng kaibigan kong natapilok sa trampoline.",1

FIRST OF ALL, OPPOSITION IS WEAK. malakas pa rin ang suporta ng mga tao kay duterte, idagdag mo pa ang mga marcos loyalists
Kung opposition votes lang ang aaasahan natin, mga around 6-7 million lang ito. Trust me yan lang ang makukuhang boto ni leni sa 2022. 
Kaya nga kailangan ang suportahan natin ay ang kandidato na nasa Gitna, hindi masyadong anti, hindi rin pro duterte. Para makuha natin ang mga alternative/neutral votes. Pati na rin ang mga ex DDS na kahit dismayado kay duterte eh ayaw parin bumoto ng dilaw. 
Ang problema kasi sa inyo, ayaw nyong mag compromise. Andami nyong ayaw na kandidato. 
Dapat as long as its not marcos or duterte, you should be fine with it. It does not matter kung ex DDS yan or enabler yan. Kung itong tao nato ang makakatalo kay bong bong, dapat siya ang suportahan natin.
