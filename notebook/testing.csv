Then in 2016 Pacquiao made a remark against gays and lesbians calling them ""worse than animals"" with matching bible verse.

We should all live our lives by being the best people we can and tolerant of all other people and their choices in life (within reason, not things like rape, murder, etc.) and that's all there is to it. Plain and simple disliking someone because they are gay is the dumbest thing ever and if you really believe in the bible and God then you are committing a sin right there by judging them and you are not supposed to do that, but again people use religion to condemn things they don't like and these people don't apply it to themselves and what they do.",2,2023-01-06 07:55:18

Pacquiao is blunt, but his words are not only reserved for certain groups. Judgement for our sins awaits ALL of us.

Thankfully He has given grace in the form of faith to us through the cross of calvary.

The actual terminology used is translated as ""a man bedding a boy"" so in today's society our word would be ""pedophilia"". Then there's the context, most of the rules were written to stop those who were supposed to be following Judaism from being influenced by the cultural environment they were in at the time (i.e. Greek, Roman, Persian, Egyptian, etc.). 

These stains have just weaponized the texts to reflect their agenda and justify the reasoning behind being foul creatures of pettiness, spite, and hate. There's no excuse for it anymore, it's always been bigotry and it is time to show that there is no place for this mentality in an advancing society. It's time to leave the bigots in the past that they so covet and move on without them. This is not something we can be bipartisan about, there's no agreement to come to. They are evil end of story.


Edit: some people are saying the stigmatizism towards homosexuals was always around but I never said the people never had an issue with it. I said the diety never had an issue with it and you absolutely cannot prove he did!! We are talking about words these unstable individuals were hearing spoken by an invisible fairy in their heads!! That is a massive mental well-being red flag!!

The fluidity of this religions arguments were enough to make me realize how fake it is. Look at how they treat women. You have them saying women cannot be leaders yet you have Aquila and Priscilla leading in the early churches. The passages the criticize female leadership were taken wildly out of context to fit an agenda and used to control a population. Oh and revelations already happened so there will be no silly rapture the context that this is referring to is Titus destroying Jerusalem in 70 CE",55,2023-01-06 14:41:36

Bautista was interviewed recently by GQ in connection with the buzz surrounding his role in Glass Onion.

Bautista's remarks about the tattoo and Pacquiao was part of that interview.

It happened in 2016, but Bautista didn't speak about it at the time.

It's being posted now, because it's new information that only surfaced now.

It's not a case of _""we already knew that Bautista had this tattoo and we already knew that he had it covered up in response to Pacquiao's remarks and it's being surfaced again out of nowhere just to slam Pacquiao""_ - it's genuinely fresh information, even if it happened six years ago, and whether or not Pacquiao has changed his views on the LGBT community since 2016 is irrelevant to Bautista's reasons for doing something in 2016.",54,2023-01-06 05:53:48

Given the context of the rest of the Book of Leviticus and that there was not really a distinction between civil law and religious law at the time, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much of a stretch to argue that Leviticus discourages homosexuality for hygienic reasons, not moral ones, at a time when they didn‚Äôt have the clearest understanding of STDs (or, like, access to modern plumbing).

Some temples allowed prostitution as a form of worship. There are even examples of Greek families prostituting their children to curry favor with political and religious leaders. Now you should be able to see why the leader of Judaism did not want their followers to practice this, it gave the power to the other religions.

If you want to go down the route then explain the paradox of an omnipotent, all-knowing being and free will. You can't claim to be omnipotent but be incredibly controlling to the point you cull entire civilizations for being different. How can a God who claims to be love be the source of such destruction and wrath? Explain the Gnostic Gospels and the catholic churches effort to scrub them from history because they show that Judaism had multiple gods like everyone else. 

To say religion is not propaganda is a lie. It could be used to do good but it is used for evil and oppression. Any human with a moral conscious sees this hence the mass exodus of religion in today's society. I, personally, cannot phathom condemning a people because of their actions with consenting adults just because I don't participate.

The use of the verb ""reveals"" implied that it was new information.

I will grant that the OP took a screenshot of a tweet, instead of linking to the tweet directly, but if you actually did want to dig into this issue, it would have made sense to, for example:

* notice that the screenshot indicates a link to an article on people.com
* google a search string such as ""people.com dave bautista pacquiao""
* follow the search result that goes to people.com, which would bring you to this article: [Dave Bautista Covered Manny Pacquiao Tattoo After Homophobic Statement: 'It's a Personal Issue'](https://people.com/style/dave-bautista-covered-manny-pacquiao-tattoo-after-homophobic-statement/)

The article is dated January 5, 2023, and says:

> Although he did not mention his former friend by name, the Glass Onion star, 53, revealed to GQ that he had a tattoo of Filipino boxing champ Manny Pacquiao's team logo removed from his left forearm.

And the article also links to a tiktok, posted by GQ, as a snippet of that interview (though not in reference to the specific remarks about Pacquiao).

\___

> With that in mind, was my wondering if there was a new development on this issue such a big deal?

Your phrasing made it sound like any change-of-mind that Pacquiao might have had since 2016 somehow delegitimizes Bautista doing what he did beforehand.

Batista was a true wrestler (olympic style wrestling) and a purple belt Jiu-jitsu practitioner. Which was why he entered MMA in his 40s after his WWE stint.

Wrestling is an ancient martial art practiced by Romans, Greeks, Persians, Chinese, Mongols, Ottoman warriors. Different variations of wrestling became the base of certain modern grappling arts like Judo, then Judo became the base of Sambo and Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.

If the scripted combat in WWE is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word wrestling then shame on you. Ignorance is bliss.
 
You will realize that wrestling is an efficient form of combat because once you get thrown by a Wrestler via suplex, or a Judoka's Uchi-Mata on a rock hard pavement. It's enough for you to sustain lethal injuries and concussions. Moreso if they apply submission locks leaving you with broken limbs. They can even instantly kill you with choking techniques.",0,2023-01-06 10:36:51
461,j36x55k,Philippines,David Bautista Covered Manny Pacquiao Tattoo After Homophobic Statement,,YunaKinoshita,"Nope! Styles make fights. I practice Judo and Muay Thai myself.

Why do you think boxers clinch each other? That's to prevent the opponent from throwing a punch. In the eyes of a casual observer they just call it hugging but a simple tactic such as clinching is an effective tool to render one's boxing useless. What more if it was an actual grappling technique complete with grabs, throws, sweeps, submissions?

Why do you think grappling have become an essential discipline in MMA? If you compete in MMA with just striking alone you'll get destroyed by any decent grappler.

In a strategic and tactical perspective. If Batista leverages his experience in Olympic Style Wrestling plus his knowledge in Jiu-jitsu as a Purple Belt. Pacquiao's Boxing is no match no matter how great he was. 

Look for the fight between Muhamad Ali(All Time Greatest Boxer) vs Inoki (Wrestler). Even with special rules where Inoki couldn't use the full extent of his wrestling abilities. The fight resulted into a draw since Ali despite his mobility, speed, and power couldn't hurt Inoki who was mostly staying low on the ground where Ali couldn't reach him with his punches. On the other hand Inoki was banned to use takedowns. Therefore it became a stalemate.

Another example was James Toney(IBF middleweight and cruiserweight boxing champion) vs Randy Couture (NCAA Division I Greco Roman Wrestling Champion, UFC champion) Immediately after the bell he shoot for a takedown, pinned and submitted James Toney.",0,2023-01-06 13:40:02

For those who are unaware with Philippine politics, Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. (also known locally as BBM, taken from his nickname + surname initials) is the 17th and current President of the Philippines. If you do know your contemporary history, then that surname should ring a bell; the current president is the son of dictator and kleptocrat Ferdinand Marcos Sr, whose rule is infamous for corruption, extravagance, and brutality. To make a long story short, the Marcos clan is back to being the top ruling class of the country, thanks in part of disinformation and cult of personality. Marcos Jr does not acknowledge the atrocities his father's rule has done during his reign. Marcos Jr also has his own share of controversies.

His camp has been caught committing large vote-buying especially  in their rallies. Not to mention he has a well-oiled machinery with his disinformation campaign. Hell he shouldn't have been eligible to run for public office since he is a convicted tax evader. But COMELEC (Commission on Elections) gave him a free pass and allowed him with a very dumb reason. Our Supreme Court also junked the case on the validity of his candidacy. The previous president Duterte is a Marcos ally and almost all of the COMELEC commissioners were appointed by him some of which have questionable backgrounds.

1353,ipa87ji,Philippines,BBM getting booed in the US,,lastroids,"Filipinos have a penchant for nicknames no matter the age. The names can have somewhat logical reasoning behind them but sometimes they might not. For example, ""Ramon"" can turn into ""Mon"", ""Mong"" or even ""Bong"". Sometimes, people just end up being nickname~~s~~d ""Boy"" or ""Girl"" or ""Girly"" just because. That's how you end up with a 40 year old man with a nickname like ""Baby"".

It is also common for nicknames to be just 1 syllable just repeated. For example, someone named ""Emily"" might have ""Em-em"" as a nickname. I have a 30 yr old nephew called ""Boyboy"", for example. 

So for your question as to why the current tax-evading-and-atrocities-denier president of the Philippines is called ""Bongbong"", it's because that's what his narcissistic-money-grubbing parents chose to call him. 

You know how politicians in America that are usually decked out in fancy suits, inexplicably show up with rolled up sleeves come election campaign season? It's how they show how hard working and relatable they are to the common people. In the Philippines, politicians do that same thing by campaigning with their nicknames. As for party-boy-coke-loving Bongbong, they also chose to market him with that name because **Ferdinand Marcos Jr** might just remind people too much of Martial Law in the 70s and how awful his family is. At least that's what my friend that works in PR said.",28,2022-09-21 03:09:54
1354,ip84a23,Philippines,BBM getting booed in the US,,PrivatesPaces773,"A more accurate Fil translation of ""wall"" would be ""dingding"". Roof is ""bubong"". I believe there is an interview where Marcos Jr. actually explained how people started calling him ""Bongbong"".",11,2022-09-20 18:12:09
1355,ir37w3e,Philippines,BBM getting booed in the US,,Professor-ChristianX,"How do Filipinos get their nicknames? Many nicknames are bestowed by parents or other elders on children while they are still toddlers.

We Filipinos tend to be more relaxed than Americans, both in terms of daily life/habits and in terms of viewpoints. This informality leads us to prefer the informal names.

Americans tend to be more career-focused than Filipinos on some aspects. That‚Äôs why this outlook makes them feel that it‚Äôs smart to have a formal name to fall back on for future professional use ‚Äî that having a nickname-only name could be limiting.

Even former American President George W. Bush is widely known to use several nicknames to refer to journalists, fellow politicians, and members of his White House staff. Americans loves to use codenames and nicknames as well. Most authors use pseudonym or fictitious names.

The act of nicknaming is not unusual in itself‚Äîother dialects of English do it too, in similar morphological ways, but perhaps in more restricted contexts, such as the aforementioned baby talk and pet names but before colonisation, Filipino names were inspired by nature, cultural and religious beliefs, characteristics and familial affinity. Standard naming conventions came with the arrival of the Spaniards and Catholicism.

Where does the name Bong Bong come from? His parents gave him that nickname, and in our culture, our parents mostly giving us funny nicknames so that they can call us quickly and uniquely. So it‚Äôs not something new. Etymology: The word bong is an adaptation of the Thai word bong or baung (Thai: ‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á, \[b…îÃÇ≈ã\]), which refers to a cylindrical wooden tube, pipe, or container cut from bamboo, and which also refers to the bong used for smoking. There is no standardized way of naming, especially first names, in the Philippines in contemporary times.

During the pre-Spanish period, the population of the Indigenous people of the Philippines was small so naming was mostly an attribution of first names. Names were largely based on nature, cultural and spiritual beliefs. People in the past didn't have last names because the population was small and there was no need to distinguish between families.

Well, I love partying and I love coke too. During our teenage life, I bet we all experienced that. Not unlike in the US. Underage drinking is a serious public health problem in the United States. Alcohol and drugs is the most widely used of abuse among America's youth. Oh my, your country has more serious problems than ours, am I right?!?

Politicians in America usually show up with rolled up sleeves during election campaign season. You‚Äôre right, It's how they show how hard working and relatable they are to the common people.

In the Philippines, politicians have a different way of campaigning. They would bring popular personalities, inviting celebrity to sing and performers to attract crowd but mind you we vote wisely. We have our candidates, and I myself, choose who will serve best in our country.

Well, as you can see, first of all they can‚Äôt hide that Ferdinand Marcos Sr. is his dad. Most candidates using their nicknames not only BBM. FYI! When his dad declared martial law in 1972, that‚Äôs in response to the ""communist threat"" posed by the newly founded Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), which is in fact true and correct and the sectarian ""rebellion"" of the Mindanao Independence Movement (MIM). I can see that you are not aware of our history, and you‚Äôre more like a sucker and not a critical thinker. Same with your PR as well. Read and study our history first before you comment, you guys look ridiculous and stupid.

In the case of Bong Bong Marcos, let us not forget that he is the product of the corrupt system that governs our political system. Why? Simple logic. Had the Aquinos and the succeeding presidents done their jobs well and really served the people, then the people would never have looked for a Marcos leadership again. In fact, if they are really corrupt, really stole money from the coffers of the government, then why were all the charges against them were dropped despite the fact that the prosecutor of the case during the trial of the century, Rudy Giulianni was able to imprison the five heads of the biggest crime families in New York City? In fact, the people elected leaders like Ramos and Enrile, both were supposedly equally accountable to the ""atrocities' ' committed during Martial Law but again the blame was only focused on a single person. Much worse, they blame the son for the sins of the father.

in HongKong last 2019, to prove their point that they are right. Then as for these destabilization plots, the media will be portraying them as ""peaceful protests'' as they did with the BLM movements and when the president is forced to declare Martial Law, they will further condemn him, forcing him to act with a strong hand so they can paint him as brutal which is the same strategy they did in 1972. These people do not care for democracy. They just use the word for their own gains and they know that it is the youth who can easily be beguiled and deceived into thinking they are new Jose Rizals and freedom fighters of the century.

It is just that the people should see this perspective.",2,2022-10-05 00:18:28

The 2nd gen Filipinos from the 70's and 80's are still largely conservative, but do have Democratic tendencies depending on location (West coast mostly Dem, while East coast, Southern, and Midwest mostly Rep). The millennials and more current generations that grew up in the US are the ones who are largely liberal, regardless of location.

1675,hsbuygj,Philippines,What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,Japponicus,"Copy/pasted my answer from another post: 

I grew up in a homophobic environment, and so initially I was also anti same sex marriage. What changed my view was when I read an account of a gay man who got into a traffic accident and was rushed to the ER, unconscious. The only person whom he considered his family was his longtime boyfriend, because when he came out to his real family, he was immediately disowned and thrown out of the house. But the hospital wouldn't recognize the BF as family, coz they were neither blood-related nor a married couple. So the BF could not even visit his partner in the ER, but worse than that was there was no one who could give consent to perform life-saving procedures on the guy. I do not recall how the story ended though, so I can't remember if the guy survived or how it worked out in the end, if ever.  
  
This story made me rethink my view. I mean, they were consenting adults who were not doing anyone harm by being together. And if one or both of their respective families had disowned them, then they only had each other to rely on. So what's wrong with letting them be together legally, so that they may provide to institutions the proper documentation of their relationship that is required? It's not like the LGBT community is asking religions to allow them to be wed; they only want to have legal weddings, not church ones. And only because there are certain impediments to non-legal couples, as well as some perks (like tax breaks) for the legal ones.

There are other stuff that I don't have:

-Automatic designation as next of kin by medical professionals
-Joint ownership of property
-Joint tax filings

God help your conscience if this person decides then and there that they are beyond help. As a psychology student, I can tell you that mental illnesses are not just environmental factors. You can inherit mental disorders. You are more prone to mental disorders if your parents have had mental disorders. By this logic diba, it is therefore a sin that you are born, kase maybe the reason why you're depressed is because your parents passed that onto you, you sinful bastard.

The reason why people don't get annulled will also be the reason why people will not get divorced if that will ever be implemented in ph. 

The church does allow seperation thru annulment, but people are just not educated enough to know that it exist or even know how to do it. Some are just choosing to stay because of many complicated reasons. Simply making divorce legal won't make people divorced their abusive partners any easier. 

About the marriage thing, I once had a prof that would say that infertility can be a reason to invalidate a marriage based on religious reasons. So yes, they can't get married religiously. 

About same sex though, marriage is inherently a religion thing. My stance here is, sure they can legally marry but just not religiously aka in church. 

There is this thing called a civil wedding. Where u get married in the eyes of the gov't and not the church. 

So here's what I think, civil wedding and religious wedding should be seperate, civil wedding should allow same sex wedding but the religious wedding can keep their restriction. I think this would be a good compromise.",1,2022-01-12 17:59:57

Kung pamayanan ang usapan, ang pamilya ang pinakabasic na unit. Basically, always, ALWAYS treated na default ang pamilya sa mga bagay bagay patungkol sa isang tao. Ano ibig kong sabihin dito?

* Kapag kapakanan ng bata ang usapan, magulang ang unang unang dapat na nakikialam at responsable
* Kapag may isang taong pumanaw na walang naisusulat na huling habilin, pamilya yung legal na tagapagmana.
* Kapag ang isang lalakeng pamilyado eh nag-isip na gusto kong magbuhay binata ulit, karapatan ng asawang babae na maghabol ng sustento para sa mga anak. At karapatan ng asawa na magsampa ng demanda laban sa nangangaliwang asawa.
* Ang isang senior citizen na pensionado ng SSS, kapag siya ay pumanaw ay makakatanggap pa din ng benepisyo ang naulilang asawa (unless mag-asawa siya ulit)

HIndi po isinusulong ng mga pro-same sex marriage ang more rights, they are just asking for equal. Pantay na proteksyon sa ilalim ng batas. Hindi naman mawawasak ang pamilya mo pag ang LGBT eh malaya nang ikasal sa kung kanino nila gusto. (Kasi pag nawasak yung pamilya mo, that's on you, not them).

Bakit nga ba isyu ito ng equal rights? Kasi una sa lahat, walang sinoman ang kayang pagbawalan kang mahalin ang taong mahal mo. Pangalawa, maliban na lang sa pakikiapid sa taong may asawa na, hindi bawal sumama sa iba pang tao na kagaya mo. Walang batas na nagdidikta kung sino lang ang pwede mong mahalin. Pwede kang ikasal sa taong kababata mo, pwede kang ikasal sa nakilala mo na matanda ka na, pwede kang ikasal sa foreigner. Kung umibig ka man sa taong kaparehas mo ng kasarian, hindi naman sex lang ang nakasama sa isang relasyon. Pag mahal mo ang isang tao, it is friendship and more. At pag ikinasal ka sa kanya, sinasabi mo sa harap ng madla na mahal ko ang taong ito at tatanda akong kasama siya. Maaari kaming mag-anak, maaari ding hindi, pero siya ang pinili kong maging pamilya ko. Siya ang mundo ko, may anak man o wala.

That, Mr. Congressman, is what you are saying no to. This isn't a topic of what goes to which hole, or whether or not you like it or if you're disgusted by it. Standing by your own words makes it look like pinakasalan mo lang ang asawa mo para anakan.",1,2022-01-12 19:07:34

it is a union for any gender‚Äôs or any sexuality‚Äôs form of love.

marami naman kasi masasabi ang lipunan eh, pero madalas, hindi nakakabuti or wala namang maiaambag sa pamumuhay mo.

let them be. (the same-sex couples in accordance with the topic)
 
kasi if the concern naman is sexual intercourse for reproduction, nature na iyan. Dadami at dadami parin naman ang tao.

However, due to my experience as part of the GenZ and through some millennial‚Äôs testimony, lipunan din ang nagpabago sa mindset nila kaya marami ang ayaw nang magka-anak, for the betterment of their children not knowing the world na kinagisnan nilang mamulat sa mapanghusga at punong-puno ng pait na mundo.

Because religion guides us to establish actions and decisions morally, if it's right or wrong. For example, someone wants to create a law. The 10 commandments in Christianity stated that no one shall harm others. Hence, that will be their basis if that law can harm anyone. If there is someone that will be harmed by this law, then it must be rejected.

Kaya I don't agree on this na dapat hiwalay ang religion and politics. But I believe na dapat may boundaries 'to kasi may mga times na nakikisali ang some members ng church like the opportunist priests na gagawin ang lahat para sa kanila lang mapunta ang benefits. They preach about the Bible yet hindi naman nila isinasabuhay. Parang panahon ng Kastila lang ang vibes. Hindi sila mga totoong tagasunod ng Diyos dahil ginagamit lang nila ang name of God para maka angat.

But in a Annulment, those who were have more assets will benefit a lot. 

The only difference is that Annulment cost a lot and is also very hard to file but this still depends on the country because a Divorce can be as expensive as an Annulment, but in the Philippines a Divorce cost way less than an Annulment and the chances are it won‚Äôt even be approved by the Court compared to a Divorce where it‚Äôs less strict in the conditions but the conditions depends on your country.

Baka kasi hindi ka pa fully informed or tamad ka lang magresearch since hindi ka siguro directly affected (meaning you or your loved ones wont ever need abortion, or can afford one when the time comes). Kasi decriminalizing abortion is for the poor women. Wealthy women do it all the time whether legalized or not. Ang kawawa kasi dito yung mga walang kakayanan.

Wait. Paki dagdag na rin. Ibig sabihin ba kapag ang babae narape doon lang siya pwede magpa abort? Does it mean, someone has to violate her body muna before she can decide for her own?

Also! Corpses or brain dead ppl are protected by law na bawal galawin katawan nila. So mas may body autonomy pa ang patay kaysa sa buhay na babae.

Also!!!! Kung ""ikaw gumawa yan panindigan mo"" ibig sabihin ba mga bata ay form of punishment lang? By that sense, pangit na kaagad. Kaya nabubuhay tayo sa society na lagi sinusumbat sa mga anak na hindi sila pinalaglag. Lol.

Also also also last na!!! Kung papairalin yung logic ulit na ""ikaw may kasalanan, ikaw magbayad"". Ibig sabihin ba yung mga naaksidente dahil sa drunk driving (sabihin natin yung may kasalanan na drunk driver same na same sila ng blood type nung nabiktima niya) at kunwari dahil sa aksidente nawalan siya ng paa ibig sabihin ba nun by all force kukunin yung paa nung drunk driver since siya naman may kasalanan? So ibig sabihin mas may bodily autonomy pa ang isang kriminal kaysa sa mga babae.

Also. Dont pls use the ""ipa-adopt"" card. Overflowing na ang orphans. Plus majority of the orphaned girls are raped. Cycle repeats bec of their inaccessibility to safe abortion.

Isipin niyo nalang pls. Tsaka magresearch kayo. Normal ang abortion before colonization. Pinapairal lang yan dati kasi the more slaves, the more maganda yung work force and beneficial sa mga slave owners. Free country na tayo lol. Very medieval ang pagcriminalize sa abortion.",3,2022-01-20 08:43:16

The problem is that we dont have a clear definition of what ""homophobia"" or ""LGBT discrimination"" is. The SOGIE Bill did a decent job outlining it, but there's still a lot of stuff missing there

Medyo complicated pa ang issue

For example, we have a law that protects religious freedom. Churches are free to believe (and preach) that being gay is wrong. That means LGBT couples cannot force pastors or churches to officiate their wedding. That's pretty simple and straight forward. But that's just scratching the surface. What about catering services owned by Christians? If they refuse to accept the gay couple as clients, is that discrimination? What if the gay couple likes a certain garden and they want that place to be the venue of their wedding but the owner is Christian? What about clothes? Can religious gown-makers refuse to sell a wedding gown to a transgender?

Kahit yung mga tao na pro-LGBT, hati sila sa issue na to. Some say that yes, as business owners they have the right to choose their clients based on their religious affiliation. Others say that they cant because that's discrimination. They say that refusing to accept gay people as clients is similar to putting up a sign on your store that says ""only white people can buy here""

>**1st It is a cash grab relationship, in the west especially in the USA if you are a woman you can get marry from a rich person and steal their money by just divorcing them.** 

Two points here: (1) a spouse only has claim to assets that were acquired or ""grown"" during the marriage, not everything. For example, if you acquired a house while married, the spouse can claim half of the value of that house but if that house was purchased by one of the spouses before marriage, then the other spouse can only claim half of the increase in property value. i.e., if a house was bought for $200,000 and is now worth $250,000 at the breakdown of marriage, the other spouse can only file for a claim to half of the $50,000 value. (2) there is a thing called prenuptial agreement, into which many couples enter. This clearly establishes what you owned prior to being married, and assuming it is executed and signed properly, would always stand to protect those assets.  


>**2nd It is generational, there are a lot of single mothers had childrens who also more likely to be single mothers in the future due to not having fathers.** 

There are so many factors leading to divorce, not just ""because I don't have a father."" Sigmund Freud may be the founder of psychoanalysis but there is very little evidence that his theory on the Electra complex is real. Most psychologists do not believe it's real. My parents have been married for 46 years and are still very much in love to this day, sometimes to an adorably cringey level, but I made a careful, long thought-out decision to file for a divorce from my former spouse even if I have a father.

Besides, the definition of family is evolving. It is no longer just ""mother-father-children"" today. Even the UN defines family as ""those members of the household who are related to a specified degree, through blood, adoption or marriage."" There is no clear requirement that a family needs to have a mother and a father.

I have been a single mother for 20 years to two boys. Through blood, sweat, tears and determination, I can say both my sons are on good paths. One is a paramedic, the other one is in the university on a scholarship studying psychology. Both are in very health relationships.  So I hope my anecdotal evidence shows that not all children of single-parent families end up ""broken"".   


>**3rd You can get force to pay child support to a child you didn't even know or even own.** 

Marriage and child support are two different things. One does not need to be married to be responsible for child support. If the court establishes that the child is yours (through you acknowledging that you are a parent by welcoming the child into your home and caring for them as your own or through a paternity test), then parents become responsible to support their children financially. When a divorce occurs and one parent has physical custody of the children, that parent's responsibility is fulfilled by being the custodial parent. The other parent then makes a child support payment to fulfill their non-custodial parent financial responsibilities.

Child support will generally not apply if: (a) the child is no longer a minor unless the child is still in high school or has special needs, (b) the child becomes active duty in the military, (c) parental rights are terminated through adoption or another legal process, or (d) the ‚Äãminor child is declared legally emancipated by a court (in which case the court has determined the child is able to be self-supporting). Stepfathers are not usually financially liable for child support. The exception is when a stepfather legally adopts a child.  


>**I can agree on individuals that are abused by their husbands or wives. But if abuse is the main problem, divorce is certainly not the solution and the silver bullet to solve the problem. I believe in a word family, because I live with them as a whole. But I could never live without them, living apart.**

Capitalism is ALWAYs political. Capitalism is an economic system and economic matters are always political because of how modern industrial economies work.

Even beyond that, capitalism exalts the accumulation of wealth (capital) above all else so the one you commented on is correct there(why downvote them?). This accumulation of wealth is used to further accumalate even more wealth via investment of these capital towards ownership of means of production. 

This snowballing of wealth accumulation and given how essential production is to modern societies (and capitalist own them) give the rich an ENORMOUS political influence and leverage. This is why socialists say capitalism was and is still not compatible democracy.

I do not intend to offend anyone. But I just want to ask these questions so that we can be enlightened about the different sides of the issue.

In the first place, bakit pa nagse-sex ang mga tao kung alam naman nila mismo sa sarili nila ang mga consequences? May nabasa ako kanina and I agree with them; sex is a choice hindi naman iyan sobrang daling gawin na parang isang sanggi mo lang may nangyari na. There is more into that, there is so much to prepare, bago pa mapasok ang isa sa ano, may malaki kang free will kung itutuloy mo. If you understand me, alam mong ibig kong sabihin na everything about sex requires free will. They have the power to stop. 

And I am surprised nang may mabasa ako dito sa thread na ito kung saan sinabi niya na pampahaba lang ng proseso ang kasal para lang makapag-sex. So, you do not consider sex as a big decision, a sacred decision? Because I believe that sex is not supposed to be like a game. Gagawin mo lang kasi gusto mo, kasi masarap? Don't get me wrong, I also believe that sex is a part of the normal function of a human body. But I do not consider it ‚Äúhobby.‚Äù

Kasal is something like basbas sa relasyon, hindi lang basta-basta pampahaba ng proseso para lang makapag-sex ang dalawang tao. It is a ceremony to create the promise, the commitment para mahalin mo ang isang tao nang buo. Aalagaan mo siya, magiging responsable ka kasi iisa na kayo. At dahil iisa na kayo, doon na pumapasok ang sex because of your fervent love. Again, I believe that sex is not supposed to be a hobby.

Iyon ang aking stand here. I hope someone would answer these questions and provide their own stand in this. I assure you that I will try my best to be respectful as I can. I am also trying to establish din ng mga discussions.",1,2022-06-22 15:14:17

Also, I'm sorry but your experience is not true for a lot of couples so you shouldn't impose legal restrictions on them just because it worked out for you. And abuse isnt the only reason to end a marriage. You can be in a non abusive relationship and it can still take an emotional toll because you're forced to stay in a relationship you don't want.

Also, divorce is not the same as an annulment. A divorce dissolves a marriage while an annulment is a declaration you were never married in the first place.

Up until today madaming kabit,kirida,concubine you get the idea. They know the consequences and yet they are doing it. You may wonder why? Siguro bored sila sa asawa nila. Who knows? Life isn't always plain black and white.  

‚Äì Thank you for clearing this up. I don't understand kasi noong una kung bakit nagse-sex ang dalawang tao even though they have the power to prevent it.


And yet we have a lot of cases of premarital sex and abortion. Merong free-will yes, choice nila, pero usually yung reason ""nagkamali"". We cannot really undo what we've already done.  

‚Äì Maybe because of not enough sex education. Gaya ng sabi mo kanina, maraming curious kaya nila ginagawa. Tapos minsan kapag wala sa sarili (ex. 'pag lasing), nagkakamali sila. 

Noong una kasi, yung perspective ko ay nasa mga taong nag-eenjoy kahit may kakayahan namang magpigil at alam naman ang consequences tapos mamomroblema kapag nabuntis. 


Why is sex a ""sacred decision""? Sacred to you probably because of your religion. And according to what? To your beliefs?  

Akin lang, buhay nila yan. Kung ano man ang gawin nila sa buhay nila, responsibility nila. Ang may pwede lang bumatikos sa parties involved ay yung taong related sa parties na involved. Kung ""game"" para sa kanila then let them. Kung may talo sa ""game"", can we really do anything about it? The only thing that I know of that we can do is to condemn the abuser on the internet (since social media is a powerful tool). Worse kung teenagers pa lang, but if they are rich, at the very least they can finance to support themselves if there is an unwanted pregnancy. In regards sa same sex-marriage, basta walang tinatapakan. Same with any other relationships.

‚Äì What I mean in sacred decsion is that sex is very important to consider. Hindi siya gagawin mo lang kung gusto mo. Na kapag inatake ka ng lust mo, gagawin na.


On the other hand, I fully agree and support Same-Sex Marriage din. 'Yun din kasi ang iniisip ko. Kung wala namang nasasaktan (ethical), why not? Kung makakatulong sa pagpapaunlad ng buhay ng dalawang tao, why not? 

Sabi nga sa Bible, wag kang gagawa ng masama sa kapwa mo. ‚ÄúLove Thy Neighbor.‚Äù So for me, it should be acceptable in our religion. I don't get the reasoning na ipinagbabawal ng Diyos 'to. Religion should not be the problem in this Same-Sex Marriage kasi sa una pa lang wala naman itong problema sa kanila. Yung iba't ibang interpretation lang talaga ang naghi-hinder dito.

Heck, the only thing skewing the numbers is china's explosive economic growth and their consumption is partially because they produced stuff for the world basically, not just for domestic consumption. Making North America and Europe have the most footprint cumulatively, and per capita.

2687,hscih9a,Philippines,What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,scionspecter28,"Firstly, adoption of small families means that we recognize the fact that the greatest action an individual can take to decrease their carbon emissions is to have one fewer child. An additional child can contribute up to 58.6 tonnes of carbon/year compared to other actions such as recycling, not flying, or having a vegetarian diet which are in the single digits. This also goes for families in the developing world especially in the middle class who have the propensity to consume like their first-world counterparts. Moreover, poverty in developing nations has its roots in the default thinking to have large families. It is a social justice issue when you think about how these poor families who live on less than $2 a day cannot altogether have a good standard of living because the Earth cannot accommodate this ideal. All 7.9 billion people would have to live like impoverished people compared to a more equitable state of affairs with a smaller global population.

Secondly, it‚Äôs a misconception that there‚Äôs already a declining population in Western countries when the total global population is still growing. What‚Äôs really happening is that those countries are still growing only more slowly due to instances such as Population Momentum. The only way for a visible and real decline in population is for the birth rate to be equal to the death rate. It will take some time for this to happen but successive generations choosing smaller families can have an exponential effect in shrinking the population.",0,2022-01-12 13:49:36
2688,hscf9b2,Philippines,What is your stand in Same-Sex Marriage?,,scionspecter28,"Population growth can still increase despite the growth rate due to [Population Momentum](https://ourworldindata.org/population-momentum). Basically it‚Äôs the fact that population can keep increasing due to longer life expectancy and other causes even when birth rates slow down.

Both rich and poor have their respective negative impacts on the environment. Whereas the rich have high per capita carbon emissions in line with their overconsuming lifestyles, the poor can also degrade their localities‚Äô environmental health in line with extractive activities. Consider the case of [Madagascar](https://overpopulation-project.com/the-silent-lie-in-coverage-of-madagascars-famine/) wherein majority of the population lives on subsistence farming. They don‚Äôt emit per capita emissions as those in the West. However, the sheer numbers of their population have led to widespread deforestation and loss of biodiversity. They need to cut forests to make way for more farmland to continue feeding themselves. Is it fair to ignore these pressing issues on the local level?

In short, the rich have a global impact while the poor have a local impact. There‚Äôs also the fact that developing countries such as Indonesia and India are some of the countries with the highest level of [greenhouse gas emissions](https://world101.cfr.org/global-era-issues/climate-change/who-releases-most-greenhouse-gases). The narrative, especially for those on the left, to blame Western or developed countries alone for climate change and environmental degradation can be deceiving. It does not change the fact that human population numbers, not just overconsumption, matter in the whole discussion.

I was told my school is being burned to the ground. I was informed the city jail is on fire. I was messaged the local hospital is taken over by these men in black hoods. 

Roads were blocked, fire trucks were seized, and everyone is questioned of religion. If you can't prove you are a Muslim, you are ""taken care"" of. 

I have received a message that my high school principal is taken as hostage. Along with her are many non-Muslims who strive to give education to young minds of Marawi. My sisters' classmates and their families are on their way to our house; they are running away from the threat of fire and bullets.

Black flags are raised to claim dominion of the city. 

Hope is frail as of the moment. 

I haven't heard from the local government since the mayor's interview with CNN where he is still yet to validate and collate information. ""No casualties reported"" he said.

Churches are torched. This ignorance of religious respect is on an all time high. This is taking away the culture and the history of Marawi, or my memory of it at least. 

I grew up with non-Muslim friends and educators. I am where I am right now because of them. All the people who grew up from where I did are successful because of the community we were raised in.

Instead of our homes, our schools, our hospital, and our jails, burn your ignorant and false extremist beliefs.

We are being burned down. Help us.

I stand with Marawi City and all of the people therein. Please stay strong. Lend a prayer if you can. Open your homes to those in need if you can.

Religious leaders, Ulamas, and people of high regard and influence, step in and negotiate! 

Lock your doors. Keep your windows low. Stay strong.

In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, and the Most Beneficent, light a candle and pray.""

Matagal na nangyayari ito sa Marawi noong wala pang ang ISIS, lalo na sa MSU marawi mismo. NOTE: Likely connected ang mga terrorist group at mga criminal groups sa ARMM. (Off-topic: Eto ang problema ko sa talks with MILF, kasi alam ng lahat na mga locals na takbuhan ng mga kriminal ang mga kampo nila). Kaya natatawa ako sa mga umiiyak sa ginagawa ni Duterte. Parang ngayon lang nila nalaman kung gaano kalala ang nangyayaring karahasan sa Pilipinas, which is and still happening bago pa naging presidente si Duterte (Ang mali lang ngayon eh nakisali na ang gobyerno mismo).

Matagal na walang action ang gobyerno against sa mga corrupt feudal drug lords sa ARMM. Kaya thumbs down ako kay Duterte kasi wala siyang action tungkol sa situation ng ARMM. Mukhang plano niyang i-isolate ang ARMM, lalo na kung matuloy ang federal government (meaning bahala na sila). In-appoint ni GMA si retired police general Ricardo De Leon as university president para magkaroon ng order in-campus. Pero anong nangyari? Yung mga alumni at professors(that belong to certain religious/indigenous group, you know) cried martial law. Certainly nakinabang sila at relatives nila sa corruption na nagyayari in-campus kaya nag reklamo sila. Basically, as long as makinabang sila, wala silang pakialam sa nangyayaring criminalities in-campus. Kaya ayon nag resign si De Leon after few years at bumalik naman sa dating gawi ang mga kriminal.

Matagal na to na nangyayari, so don't act so shocked. Also if the illegal setlers that belong to certain religious/indigenous group do not like their neighbors or want to widen their landspace, they will likely burn their neighbor's house. NOTE: These illegal settlers are likely related to a campus official(president, vp, etc) and professors. Wala silang pakialam.",43,2017-05-23 13:10:44

But thinking about it in my own perspective, shouldn't the Vice President take over while the President is away? That is supposed to be the job of a VP right? Or maybe because our VP is assigned to something else so she is not allowed or able to handle situations like this?

I just found out this incident today and since the Manchester incident, this day has been so long. I am not from Marawi and I am not in thr country now, but I am hoping that somehow the military troops are taking action to put these people down.

>If you can't prove you are a Muslim, you are ""taken care"" of. 

http://news.mb.com.ph/2017/05/24/marawi-stabilized-govt-in-full-control/

>Armed Forces of the Philippines-Public Affairs Office (AFP-PAO) chief Marine Colonel Edgard Arevalo Wednesday said that the situation in Marawi City has been stabilized and security forces are in full control of the situation.

>In a press statement, Arevalo also clarified that what security forces are dealing with in Marawi City are not Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) but 
>Local Terrorist Group (LTG) contrary to what is being circulated in social media.

>‚ÄúThe news being circulated by these terrorists and their sympathizers are spurious and are meant to spread lies and disinformation,‚Äù Arevalo said.

‚ÄúIt is propaganda to attract foreign terrorists‚Äô support and recognition,‚Äù he added

and

>Chief Marine Colonel Edgard Arevalo, you are F_ _ KING dreaming!!! We received a lot of infos from people inside Marawi and they are telling us there is no PNP and no AFP in the streets of Marawi. Instead, what they see are civilian men with long arms and with black ISIS bands in their heads. And you‚Äôre telling us that the AFP is in control of Marawi???

BUT, the Australian Federal Police are saying;

>President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law in Mindanao on Tuesday night after fighting raged in Marawi City between government forces and militants linked to the Islamic State (IS) group.

>Mr. Duterte made the declaration from Moscow, where he was on a four-day official visit.

>Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the declaration took effect at 10 p.m. on Tuesday.
 

> He said the declaration was good for 60 days

2879,dhxonoj,Philippines,Terrorist Attack Right now in Marawi,,peacemakerzzz,"I think the government is doing this to threaten us, and get what Duterte really wants. Masterplanned to look like an ISIS attack in Mindanao to allow him to get Martial Law in action. Crisis is solved due to Martial Law, and will be used as proof for good government. Therefore, allowing it to entrap Manila as well and threaten us with lies that ISIS really was behind it, when all these are just propaganda to market Martial Law as a means to an end. 

It's weird. It took a long time for news media to post articles online, not that they didn't have anything to capture. There are a lot of people there, enough to contact media regarding issue and none of them responded quickly. It's not making sense. 

We're relying on raw footage, as well as people posting on social media on written, in what they are really seeing. For all we know ISIS is just parading and terrorizing with most minimal casualties possible, to promote Martial Law. The only breaking news I've seen on facebook as posted by these social media news accounts were related to Du30 casting ML on Mindanao. Not entirely related to the current situation on actually helping the city. I feel sad. I, do however, am sorry for the loss of some. Will be keeping them in my thoughts.

2936,dhxt5f9,Philippines,Terrorist Attack Right now in Marawi,,Smasborgen,"Some background: About 3 weeks ago, the Philippine Military raided and [destroyed a Maute-ISIS (same group featured here) camp near the same area. The Philippine Military killed 36 and took over their base with about 48 bunkers.](http://aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/philippines-36-maute-terrorists-killed-in-clashes/804219) It was a big victory for the Philippine military against the group. 

Also, the Philippine military has neutralized [149 ISIS-linked terrorists from another group Abu Sayyaf since January 2017](http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Nation&title=abu-sayyaf-toll-81-killed-18-apprehended-50-surrendered&id=145459) which is a massive loss considering that their numbers are now in the few hundreds. 

The Philippine military killed [31 terrorists and their commander Ismael Abubakar of another ISIS affiliate called BIFF in a major battle](http://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2017/05/11/philippine-assault-on-extremists-sends-24000-fleeing/).

In the past few months ISIS affiliate organizations in the Philippines have lost a lot of strength due to heavy losses inflicted on them by the Philippine military. Likely, this is a retaliatory attack by Maute-ISIS terrorist organization to make up for their losses though it's hard to tell if they are retaliating as well for other ISIS affiliates in the southern islands of the Philippines.

This attack in particular does not seem to be a failure of intelligence per se. Paradoxically, [intel reports on the location of Islamic State head in the Philippines and leader of the Abu Sayyaf terrorist organization Isnilon Hapilon led government authorities to the area which in turn triggered the battle as gunmen encountered them.](http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/05/23/17/soldiers-cops-battle-maute-terrorists-in-marawi-city)",170,2017-05-23 17:30:24

They can blend in very well in the Muslim-majority nations of Malaysia and Indonesia (which has a large Tausug/Suluk minority in Sabah).

(Off-topic: Here is my problem with the talks with the MILF, because the locals know that their bases serve as criminal hideouts). That's why I'm laughing at the people who are crying on what Duterte does. It's as if they now know how worse [the regional] violence is in the Philippines, which is and still prevalent long before Duterte was even president. (The wrong thing now is that even the government joined in the violence)

>There has been no action from the government against the corrupt feudal drug lords in the ARMM. That's why I'm thumbs down on Duterte because he has no action in regards to the situation in ARMM. It seems that he plans to isolate the ARMM, especially if the plans for federal government continues (meaning they are left on their own). GMA^3 appointed retired police general Ricardo De Leon as the university president [of MSU] so as to restore order in-campus. But what happened? The alumni and the professors (that belong to a certain/indigenous group you know) cried martial law. Certainly they and their relatives benefited from the corruption that was going on in-campus and that's why they complained. Basically, as long as they benefited [from the corruption], they don't care about the criminalities that are going on in-campus. That's why De Leon resigned after a few years and came back again to his old criminal ways.

>This has been happening long before, so don't act so shocked. Also if the illegal settlers that belong to certain religious/indigenous group do not like their neighbors or want to widen their landspace, they will likely burn their neighbor's house. NOTE: These illegal settlers are likely related to a campus official (president, vp, etc) and professors. They just don't care.

In Libya where while the regime was overthrown, without a real democratic replacement, and the groups which the west supported in removing Gadaffi it was total chaos and a breeding ground for religious extremists. 

The SDF offers order and democracy and inclusivity, and the SAA, while I depose Assad, would bring order and peace also.

Daesh, and other terror groups, breed on instability. Attacks turn normal people onto normal muslims, who then get caught by Daesh who tell them that they'll only be accepted under the black flag.

 By reacting with solidarity against Daesh, and fighting the fear and divisions they wish to create in our societies, we can make their tactics less effective. In time, and I mean time, through restricting their ability to gain territory, and deposing reactions that will lead to more people joining Daesh in desperation and fear, we can eliminate their ideology, at least in the scale in which it exists today.

3235,dhywq74,Philippines,Terrorist Attack Right now in Marawi,,RPmatrix,"TBH friend I no longer know ""who's who'.

Then there's *far too much* of the old 'false flag' bullshit going on these days to really *know* ""who *is really behind* the flag they 'fly/uniforms they wear!"" 

False flag operations work so well becoz it's *so simple* it works! 

  Just do your plundering and killing *dressed* as someone else! 

Pirates had figured this out hundreds of years ago, and *if you fly your flag well*, your opponent might even open the door for you to come in!

e.g. we've all seen the bullshit 'false flag' events in the US (e.g. recently, marathon movies schooling) with 'crisis actors' who keep popping up *after they die*, a very strange occurance that's been happening since the turn of the century, 9/11/2001 to be precise. Moreand more people are ""dying"" in a 'terrorist event' and then amazingly being found having respawned as somebody else! It's like magic I tell ya! Like the 'magic 911 passport' *but much better!*

Ever since then we've seen more and more 'false flag events' -- where I have No idea exactly 'who was' responsible ,, and neither does anyone else 

BUT, whereas I'm happy to ""keep an open mind"" until I have sufficient evidence to support *my opinion*, unlike most of these people who *don't want to appear ignorant* if asked about it, so they ""obtain an opinion"" from various sources, that 30+yrs ago were *mainly* the MSM

BUT the Internet *has changed* ***everything***! Esp when it comes to ""obtaining an opinion""! lol Esp for people under 35yo. Evenn though, they too are strongly influence by the ""mainstream media"" particularly through the advertising of various age and demographic specific products. 

These people are also the first to 'post their opinions' on FB or YT and things grow organically from there, like those ridiculously well produced beheading videos made by .... I'm not sure! 

 I'm still undecided as I've read some quite convincing evidence that (at least) half of them are  CIA funded 'promotional videos' supported by CGI trickery, *which doesn't surprise me one bit!*,, not with people who can *and will* ""turn towers into *dust!*

 Now, as more and more people get there 'opinions' equally from things like ""FB feeds"" and sites like Reddit as they do from the MSM, which btw still has a very strong influence on society whether they like it or not!

 Esp with the ""conservative over 50 yo's""  who often still get the bulk of their 'information about stuff' from the MSM via the TV, radio and newspapers -- they've done so since they could! 

 Then they 'want their kids to agree with them' so they teach their children to have the same ""beliefs"" as they do, whether or not these ""beliefs"" are useful or not! People on the whole are selfish and stupid! 

The kind of people I'm thinking of would never even *think of* what we're discussing, let alone actually know *anything* about it. Ignorance is Bliss! and religion *is* ""the opium of the masses""

Whereas in people under 30yo where 'popular opinion' reigns are highly influence by the ""opinions of their friends"" .. and the 'beliefs' which get spread are not only 100% wrong, they do real damage. Even though some are funny *if it happens to someone else*; e.g. telling people they can 'Fast charge' their new iPhones by putting them in the microwave -- or they can *be made waterproof by download an app!*

 The crazy part is LOTS of people have fallen for such Bullshit! Don't get me started on the effects of cyberbullying on a kid with shitty parents!

So as for the 'validiity' of what I read, hear or *even see*, unless it's with my own two eyes, I'm skeptical until sufficiently convinced otherwise

that said, it doesn't surprise me that Duterte would 'use' a 'false flag' to give killings ordered by him to have a modicum of ""plausible deniability"" aka ""it wasn't *me*! It was *them* . points finger, shows flag/passport found in rubble!",2,2017-05-24 09:10:26

What really astounds me is how Jews, Christians, and Muslims don't seem to be aware that all three of them follow the same god. I'm atheist and even I know this.

All three believe in the Old Testament - Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, etc. Notice that all these names exist in all three cultures. In Arabic, the names are Nuh, Ibrahim, Ishaq, Yaqub, Musa, and Dawud, etc. In Hebrew, the names are Noah, Avraham, Yishaq, Yaqob, Moshe, and Dawid.

Their only difference is the number of prophets they believe in.

Jews don't believe Jesus  (Yeshua in Hebrew) was the Messiah or a prophet.

Christians believe Jesus was the Messiah and a prophet/son of god.

The Islam faith has taken roots in the country for centuries long before the rise of modern superpowers and any attempt at colonization by the West. Filipinos know how to deal with Islamic insurgency in their own land. For the Filipinos, it is a primarily a matter of ethnic prejudice, feudal clans, and extreme separationist ideals before global terrorism.

It's not even an ISIS organization. Just a bunch of Islamic insurgents who got their panties in a twist because for half a century now, they could never amount into anything but a headache for the military.

The government, recently, has been killing their officers and members and they are weak. It is an act of both desperation and retaliation because how *dare* the Philippine military do their job and do their job right.

The crusades were undertaken in response to the spread of Islam, which spread through the Holy Land by the sword. If it weren't for Christians fighting for and defending their land then Europe would have fallen centuries ago. (Charles Martel, Battle of Tours).

The irony is that you brought religion and athiesm in to this debate. It is a fact praying and holding solidarity does nothing immediately to help the situation. No one brought in religion or atheism, again you did. Prayer and solidarity will not stop the attack, physical action and actual outreach (e.g. spreading accurate information and making sure that people are aware of the situation) will stop the attack.

But it can also mean ""a bigot."" ISIS has reportedly threatened to cut out the tongues of anyone it hears using the term. 

This quote from the article is misleading. The author is talking as if they are all the same word (""the word"", ""the term"" and the singular ""it""). They are several different words, with different spellings and different roots, that sound similar. My point is that ISIS won't hate you if you call them ""Daesh"" because that word does not mean anything else. It sounds similar to a few other words, but it has no other meanings itself. They may hate you if you call them ""da3is"" but not ""daesh""

The point why we have extremism here is because the human race can't seem to get over their egos and just learn to agree to disagree. As species each of us have the capability to have our own respective intellects, with our own beliefs, and our own choices. 

The painful thing about it is that when we go deep, it's about our disagreements in interpretation of our Holy Scriptures. (Yes, I'm capitalizing that shit because that's what I believe in, and if you like to be atheist, then so be it.) Some Muslims prefer the interpretation that is more leaning to peaceful resorts, some don't. 

That's fine, but if it affects everyone, our humanity, and if people will take action that will involve breaking decency and whatever holds us as a modern civilization, and if you're that kind of person who will fuck everyone else that doesn't agree with you, that's what's wrong. And that's what's happening right now. ISIS (and their sympathizers like the Maute group) believes what they're doing is right, and that's dangerous.

Even if you don't believe in a higher order, wouldn't be just a nice, non-asshole way to be a good part of a society to just everybody to calm down and, if somebody else believes in a higher order, let them encourage to pray for them and wish everybody well?

Description of Slippery Slope

The Slippery Slope is a fallacy in which a person asserts that some event must inevitably follow from another without any argument for the inevitability of the event in question. In most cases, there are a series of steps or gradations between one event and the one in question and no reason is given as to why the intervening steps or gradations will simply be bypassed. This ""argument"" has the following form:

Event X has occurred (or will or might occur).
Therefore event Y will inevitably happen.
This sort of ""reasoning"" is fallacious because there is no reason to believe that one event must inevitably follow from another without an argument for such a claim. This is especially clear in cases in which there is a significant number of steps or gradations between one event and another.

Examples of Slippery Slope

""We have to stop the tuition increase! The next thing you know, they'll be charging $40,000 a semester!""
""The US shouldn't get involved militarily in other countries. Once the government sends in a few troops, it will then send in thousands to die.""
""You can never give anyone a break. If you do, they'll walk all over you.""
""We've got to stop them from banning pornography. Once they start banning one form of literature, they will never stop. Next thing you know, they will be burning all the books!""

They have the best C&C and logistics network in the world. I'm sure everyone can get behind aiding the Filipino military, outside of deploying troops or running bombing raids. ISIS is a worldwide threat that the US has raised its hand to take on. The Philippines is what it is because the US government has backed every dictator that has taken control but that's not the point here.
 
I want to see MY country help out another country because that's what makes America, America. We can help so we should. Duetre has been flirting with Russia and China, threatening US interest in the region. Helping their military take out a terrorist organization not only spreads goodwill and helps solidify our position of defending a friend, but also flexes US capabilities in the region. It's also the right thing to do. You sound like if you were visiting Manchester and that terrorist attack happened, you would walk away simply because ""not my problem.""
 
Yes, the US has its problems to deal with. We can do both, and more than just that. Maybe your country can't do more than say ""what a shame."" Mine can. I pay good tax money so we can continue doing that. Also, this isn't fucking Syria going through a civil war. This isn't Libya overthrowing their leader and terrorists just popped up out of nowhere and threaten the entire country. Philippines is politically unstable, but not because of this terrorist attack, not because of a growing insurrection. It's unstable because they have a someone who is becoming a dictator. Nothing to do with ISIS. This is a terrorist group attacking a town and killing people.

The real point here is the double standard set. For atrocities committed by the Soviet Union to be relevant, they would need to have been done because of religion. Being atheistic is not enough, or else virtually every atrocity in existence that occurred while a nation's rule was theistic can somehow be blamed on religious belief.

Violent acts perpetrated by Muslims are fundamentally different, as they are virtually all declared specifically in support of religious belief. To draw parallels to atheism, you would need specific examples of atheists killing religious people because they weren't atheists.",6,2017-05-24 01:15:39

People seem to think that religion is the root of all the evils that's happening in this world but it's not. It's every humans' capability and inclination to do evil whether they're aware of it or not that starts the flame of human suffering. You can't say for certain that these extremist groups are solely religiously-driven. No, they're just using religion as a false *pretext* to justify the atrocities they commit every time a body gets dropped on the counter. You can't say for certain that they aren't motivated politically, or that they aren't driven by their own stinkin' greed. To say that religion is the reason we have militant groups like ISIS right now is undermining the complexity behind it all and is only at most a shallow understanding of how groups like these tick. You've fallen for their propaganda if you actually so much as believed that religion is what gave birth to these groups in the first place.

No, it's just plain hatred and greed for power.

 Imo, the extremists don't even follow the statutes of their religion right so absolutely no one, especially those who are ignorant towards how a specific religion is *truly* taught and practiced, has the right to generalize that all religions are bad and/or believe that they are the source of everything bad going on right now. It's fundamentalism, a.k.a., the overly-literal, narrow-minded, **selfish**, **self-serving** and downright hypocritical reading and interpretation of a certain religion's doctrine, that's the problem here. The insurgents and extremists aside, if you've actually noticed, Muslims and Christians in Mindanao and in many parts of the country actually get along and co-exist very well in spite of religious differences, and the violence that usually occurs in the south isn't always religiously-motivated at all: clan wars happen because of feuds, bigwig companies and at times corrupt politicians kill off indigenous peoples defending their ancestral homes for the sake of stealing their land and getting them out of the way, and let's not forget that little fiasco that happened in [Maguindanao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maguindanao_massacre) a while back. I know little of Islamic faith, but if their religion were imploring them to kill off all non-Muslims in the name of Allah, then Christians living and coexisting with them peacefully in the Muslim-dominated south even in Marawi would make too little sense.

No, it's the people who delude themselves into believing that they're ""practicing"" their religion even when they're not really following them by heart and spirit while simultaneously using it as a blanket to justify their wrongdoings even if it actually goes against their religion's teachings who are the real problem here.

Like a significant portion of the population who didn't. Or were denied due to pre-existing conditions. Or who couldn't afford it but due to Obamacare could. Many more people were suddenly insured and could go to the doctor. This meant preventative care, getting at disease and sicknes before it became fatal or very expensive. IT saved money and lives. Not as much as single payer would (partially due to being able to decrease medicine costs etc). But so much better than the shit you had before.

>of course, I know several high net worth individuals living off capital gains now who also got essentially free healthcare through Obamacare despite them having $5M+ of net worth

Sure. And that is what Dems did not want but Reps fought for. And the first Trump plan was way worse. And the second one is .... deadly worse as it allows for complete deductions for the rich and increases to insane amounts for the poor. This is absurd. And should be fought against. Shit, a 1M+ earner SHOULD pay more. At worst they might not be able to buy that 5th car ... so fucking what if it pays for 100 poor people being able to go to the dentist or get physiotherapy before it fucks up their  posture permanently.

Fact is that it was worse before. And now it is better. And the republicans want to make it worse.

>A lot of middle class families were hit hard by Obamacare and had their premiums inflated by 50-100% as a result.

And now it's gonna get worse due to RepubliCare.

Shit, before they couldn't even pay for naythign or they were denied due to pre-existing conditions. Now they might pay a bit, but they get their medicine. Which will stop. Soon.

You know what? I have no idea what we are arguing about. Current healthcare is a bit more expensive but covers a lot more and covers a lot more people and covers pre-existing conditions. This is better than before evenb though it is not perfect.

> the extremists don't even follow the statutes of their religion right so absolutely no one, especially those who are ignorant towards how a specific religion is truly taught and practiced

who are you to say what the real religious practice is? who are you to claim that their direct use of words is wrong? religion offers multiple interpretations.

> has the right to generalize that all religions are bad

religion is by definition believing in something without having a shred of actual evidence. that's bad. period.

> or believe that they are the source of everything bad going on right now

strawman

> It's fundamentalism

fundamentalism works very well with the claim of absolute truths

>  selfish, self-serving

yes, these suicide bombers were very selfish/self serving

> downright hypocritical reading and interpretation of a certain religion's doctrine, that's the problem here

no. ""doctrine"" is the problem. dogma enables blind followship in the first place.

> Muslims and Christians in Mindanao and in many parts of the country actually get along and co-exist

and spread their bronzeage mythology.

> the violence that usually occurs in the south isn't always religiously-motivated at all

not always? so sometimes

> but if their religion were imploring them to kill off all non-Muslims in the name of Allah, then Christians living and coexisting with them peacefully in the Muslim-dominated south even in Marawi would make too little sense.

you don't get it. you don't get that the extremist interpretations are part of the tree of religion. if you seed religious dogma, you will harvest extremism at some point. it's inherent. all religions claim the absolute truth and if one of them gets too much influence the real face will appear.

> it's the people who delude themselves into believing that they're ""practicing"" their religion even when they're not really following them by heart and spirit

ofc their beliefs are wrong, ofc they dont make sense, ofc they suffer from a delusion. the delusion is called ""religion"". a religious extremist is not more wrong or right than any other religious follower. they have just diffrent dogmas in the same frame of religion, while both claiming to be 100% right.",1,2017-05-24 15:55:49

I don't think many, if any conflicts during WWII or the years afterwards were theistic or anti-theistic. Fundamentally they were all economic. Modern wars fought by ISIS for example are different, because the stated goal is to convert or kill non-believers.

The internal anti-theistic policies in the soviet union still make a fair point though. However, as the league of militant atheists was state sponsored there is little distinction between the organization and other anti-theistic policies enacted by the soviet union. It's not like a bunch of atheists just got together and decided to start killing/persecuting religious people.

You could say the government was atheistic, but I think Marxist would be more accurate. If you read the article you linked you can see that:
> ""Soviet law never officially outlawed the holding of religious views, and the various Soviet Constitutions always guaranteed the right to believe. However, since Marxist ideology as interpreted by Lenin[22] and his successors regarded religion as an obstacle to the construction of a communist society, putting an end to all religion (and replacing it with atheism[23]) became a fundamentally important ideological goal of the Soviet state.""

Essentially, militant atheism was a belief structure created by the soviet union that taught the values of Marxism. That isn't really the same thing as textbook atheism, because atheism is just the lack of belief in gods. I am an atheist, and I don't believe in communism. The relevant beliefs that led to the persecution of religious people in the soviet union are much more closely related to communism.

https://www.historyguy.com/21st_century_wars.html

Overall, there are a lot of conflicts on that list including quite a few Islamic conflicts that weren't well politicized, but most of them are not theistic. The Islamic conflicts may just feature more prominently in western media due to their frequent attacks on civilians in western countries, but I think this is still strongly in support of my point that theistic violence is a major relevant cause of violence, at least to westerners.

> I draw a line between atheists and anti-theists. 

That's a good distinction to make. Personally, I have nothing against most theists, like most theists I hope have nothing against atheists. But I still take issue with views that are counter productive to social and scientific progress. This seems like a no brainier, but we have a number of worrying movements such as anti-vaxxers, young earth creationists, and climate change skeptics that are damaging progress. The US president has expressed support for at least two of these movements, for example. These aren't all necessarily directly related to theism, but they are encouraged by the idea that we should teach evidence based theories along side cultural traditions as equal weight.

It's like pointing at feminism- which gave women the right to vote and spurred on equality between the sexes- and saying that it's evil because of the small group of loud misandrists. Or looking at socialism as a concept- which gave us the 8 hour work day, labor unions, healthcare through jobs, wellfare, medicaid, social programs, weekends, and a bunch else besides- and saying it's evil and always wrong, just because dictators used it as a nice cover as they came into power.

And how about you try *actually* try considering other perspectives, instead of just pretending dumbing things down is the same thing?

>You said some are good and some are evil, but I want to know why you think some can be evil. Instead of seeing me as evil, see me as a person.

Like here when you act like I'm oblivious to objectively evil people (e.g. Albert Fish, Jeffrey Dahmer) . Or that I think you're evil (I think you're an idiot, or not a person (not the case).

>Also, I laughed when you said communism is an economic system. It's an ideology guided by utopian worldviews that seeks to implement a perfect society, where everyone is exactly equal no matter the work they do or talents they possess. Socialism is the economic system that must run behind that totalitarian government, because you cannot have a free market when personal possessions don't exist anymore. Communism has never actually existed as was written, it has only been attempted to be put in place. Basically, it's never made it through the full ""worker's revolution"" because there's always another person willing to be Stalin to step up and slaughter those that take a step out of the line.

That's definitely true. Stupidity is not a religious characteristic. If anything, theism and conservatism are simply frequently found together. There is only a weak argument that climate change denial is actually taught by modern christianity. And yet, I personally know people who claim that creationism is absolutely true and in a related way that humans are incapable of causing lasting climate change.

While that example is anecdotal, there is fairly strong statistical evidence that correlates climate change denial and theism in the US:

So if I'm in a seemingly empty room, it's ""just as evidence-based"" to believe there's a unicorn in there with me as to not? Come on man. A negative claim can't technically be proven, but a positive claim that something exists requires evidence.

A quick Google search provides a different definition of atheism than what you just made up: 

*disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God or gods*

Notice how both options are included. An atheist holds the same belief toward gods as you do toward unicorns: proof or gtfo.

There are two types of atheism: gnostic and agnostic. You conflated all atheists with gnostic ones, those who claim to know there are no gods. This may seem equivalent to a theist's positive claim that a god exists, but really it's as solid as your negative belief about unicorns.

Agnostic atheism is the easiest position to logically defend, but it's essentially a meaningless distinction considering that we can't 100% KNOW anything other than that we exist, including the existence of gods and unicorns. Thus, atheism is the only logically defensible position until proof of gods is presented.",1,2017-05-24 07:40:18

I simply believe there's a right and a wrong way to practice, and a right and a wrong way to approach the idea of prayer.  And you probably do as well.  For example, if someone were to blow up a group of young girls at an Ariana Grande concert because it is their religious belief that this is a good thing, I'd say they're pretty stupid, and you would probably agree.  So we all make our judgments now and then about what's right and wrong.  It's just a matter of how specific you wish to get.  The idea of prayer as something that is beyond criticism because it's a spiritual activity is stupid to me.  Some people used to pray by sacrificing a virgin to the volcano gods.  But I don't like that version of prayer because it has a severely negative impact on others.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

Medyo dismayado lang po ako kasi halos wala kong nakitang tumakbo na nagsama sa platform nila neto.

#Possible o Magagawan po ba ng paraan ung mga government offices na essential sa mga manggagawa like (philhealth, sss, pagibig, dole, bir, nso, nbi etc.) Na habaan ng shift o kaya lagyan ng night shift?

Sa dami naman ng benefits at bonus ng mga yan impossible di mangyare. 

Dinaig pa sila ng call centre natin na 24 hours na ang serbisyo 

Business hours lang sila meron pag uwi ng manggagawa sarado na, kailan pa mag leave or di kaya umabsent para mahabol ang requirements or loans.


Di naman po makatao na kailangan pa matulog ng gabi sa labas at sa tabi ng kalsada para lang mauna sa pila dahil meron lang silang 100 or 200 na tao na tinatanggap sa araw na iyon.

(Alam kong may covid pero pre pandemic ganyan parin naman sila)

Itong administrasyon natin naglabas pangulo natin ng hotline, para pag hindi nasunod ung deadline eh isusumbong duon sa hotline.

Medyo panget na galawan po un at tamad kung iisipin. imbes na baguhin at paunlarin ang systema ng bumilis eh lalo pinipressure at tinatakot pa ang manggagawa.

Salamat po ulit Atty. Luke
naway paunlakan niyo po ang tanong ko.

Kasama na po kayo sa boto ko netong darating na election. ‚úä",21,2022-03-08 11:12:36

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

And if so, how would you ensure that the wealth tax (as a replacement for the TRAIN and E-vat) would not have adverse effects to our economy in the long run? Last po, re the ""fossil fuel phase out w transition"" how will the transition be done po? And what renewable energy sources are you looking to tap po such that the total supply of energy will lead to relativley low prices over the long term? 

That's all po sir Luke, I hope you spend some time answering my queries. One of your new supporters po. Also very proud to see a fellow bacolodnon and USLS-IS (lasalle bacolod) alumni running for a position in the senate. Best of luck po!",7,2022-03-08 11:15:05

First off, I have to admit I only found out about you through the debate when you called out Harry Roque and Larry Gadon. You really did voice out what most of us really wanted to tell them--which you did, in their faces. You have my vote and I hope you win.

I have to ask though, with the way things are going I honestly say that my vote leans heavily on Leni. Supposing (and hoping for me) that she wins, what's your take on working with her?",4,2022-03-08 10:16:55

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

I agree with your principle that the minimum wage should be a living wage. How does a national minimum wage achieve this, given that the cost of living is different for every region?

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

Medyo napapahon po ang tanong ko since women's month ngayon hehe. Do you think po ba na in terms of addressing gender inequality and misogyny, successful na kahit papaano ang country natin? You can rate po on a scale of 1 to 100 kung gaano na ka progressive sa tingin niyo ang Philippines in terms of gender equality. I'm asking po since in my everyday life as a woman, I can attest na until now sexist pa rin ang bansa natin in general. And makikita rin naman po siya in a lot of things, like yung number of rape cases, domestic abuse, yung kawalan ng law that allows divorce, and the criminalization of abortion. Pero even with all of these things, consistently pa ring nasa top 10 ang Philippines in the global ranking ng gender gap. So I'm confused po. 
TL;DR Do you think na our country can already be considered feminist and equal? If yes, why? If no, what can be done to make it more equal?

Also, wala pong Reddit yung friend ko pero super fan niyo po siya so may gusto rin daw po siya ipatanong: How do you like your eggs daw po? And do you listen to Taylor Swift daw po ba? If yes ano pong favorite niyo na song niya?

Anyway, goodluck po sa elections !! You're the best example of someone who SHOULD be in the senate, as in! Naconvince ko na po yung buong family ko na iboto kayo hehe. Btw super iconic po nung ""It's my time wag kang bastos!"" Tsaka ang catchy din nung ""I go by the record..."" As in parang nastuck po siya sa brain ko for 4 days straight",3,2022-03-08 12:34:01

Pero ganun ba talaga ka-grabe ang kasugapaan nila? Wala po bang compromise with them? Like, iregulate na lang sila instead of complete abolishment? 
2. Kung kayo po ay manalo (jusq sana naman), ano ang mga gagawin niyong hakbang para hindi na maka-takbo ulit sa pwesto ang tulad ng mga Marcoses? Yun ay kung may naiisip po kayong plano tungkol dito.  
3. Nasa isang kwarto po kayo na may hawak na baril na may isang bala sa kanang kamay, at butcher knife naman sa kaliwa. Kasama niyo po sa loob ng kwarto si Gadon at si Roque na palusob na po sa inyo na may intensyong patayin kayo.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation.

Same question po if Leni would win.

Second question, Sir, with the extremely hard living right now, do you think having a 750 peso living wage would kill small time businessmen? Or maybe those businesses who are struggling right now? 

Thank you for your time.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation.

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

I come from a privileged family and have turned a blind eye all my life to the abuses that have happened to my fellow countrymen and the Philippines. I‚Äôve been playing catch-up ever since the start of official campaign period, which was a wake up call since I found out Marcos Jr was gunning for the presidency.

That said, I‚Äôd like to ask: What are some books or resources related to Philippine history and politics that you would recommend to a newcomer? I have a physical copy of The Conjugal Dictatorship but it‚Äôs a rather heavy and lengthy material. Some light, beginner-friendly recommendations would be very much appreciated.

Thank you and stay safe!",1,2022-03-08 12:20:06

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society.

Schools usually add so many subjects that aren't worth the time of. Biggest offender would be MAPEH since they would cram so many topics and so not interconnected topics that the students usually have little to no time learning that we just do dances again and again. I cannot blame the teachers having 4 competencies under their belt but is it really necessary for a subject with 4 competencies to be taught by a single teacher in a single timeslot. In the U.S. I know MAPEH is split between 4 competencies and only P.E and Health were required to pass a grade level. Another one would be TLE where on a quarter you're taught wiring and on the next agricultural stuff. Another baking and cooking and another doing Autocad and another coding. it's like TLE Teachers are forced to learn different skills that other teachers like ESP just recite some quotes from some saint and philosopher and put ideas in our hearts. I would like to know if there's a planned change regarding these two subjects as it seems outside of practicums and activities, these subjects require rote memorization to even learn them.",1,2022-03-08 11:34:21

This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society.

Man, I'm glad to have known you due to that debate. I convinced my parents to vote for you.

Anyways po, I'm a minor. I always try to ask these in political AMAs since this is related to the youth's future.


1. Since I'm a student, I'm curious on this: apart from making education more accessible, what thing/s would you change about our current educational system?

2. Since I'm reaching of age and the recent Ukraine debacle has happened, it got me worried. How would you try approaching the Chinese question? I'm very nervous about the way geopolitics is currently approaching.
 (And if you're willing to answer this, what could we do if all-out war happens... sana wala... but it's not a 0% chance)

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

Isa na po kayo sa mga bobotohin kong Senatorial Candidates para sa ngayong paparating na election, its your time to shine.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation.

It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

I have been a supporter since your appearance on Sino SENyo, and how well you answered all questions so far on your appearances. Regardless of how you answer my questions, my support is yours for sure.

Now, for the questions:

What do you see as the underlying reasons on the exploitation of the labor workforce that are even expanding on the those in the White-Collar sector? How are you planning to address this **when** (yes, claim na natin yan) you become a Senator?

How would you work in the occasion that Ka Leody does not win the Presidential Election? By extension, how will you work in the occasion that Marcos is elected as President?

Finally, while I know that your heart, experience, and agendas are in line with supporting the labor groups and workforce, what are your other platforms that extend outside of this scope? 

And on another note, anong pinakamemorable na interaction nyo with the labor sector? It could be wholesome, tugged your heartstrings, or is just very impactful to your general outlook in life.

Thank you for standing up and actually attending this AMA and the debates. Salute to the gigachads!",1,2022-03-08 10:47:55

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation.

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

To get to know more about me, here is my [one page profile](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1499242488745570305) and [overview of my platform](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1485099222928338946).

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

To get to know more about me, here is my [one page profile](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1499242488745570305) and [overview of my platform](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1485099222928338946).

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

To be completely honest, while I really do sympathize with the people, most especially the marginalized, a part of me believed na rallies were just excessive and pointless since it doesn't really work. We had thousands of people who marched to oppose the Anti Terror Law and thousands of people who pushed for Mass Testing during the beginning of the pandemic only for the people's cries to fall on deaf ears. 

However,¬† I remember what Ka Leody said during the first SMNI debates na wala naman talaga gusto mag welga and that no would willingly put themselves under the scorching heat and risk being violated by the police if hindi naman kailangan at wala silang pinaglalaban. It made me realize na just because may mga peace talks na nahaganap, it doesn't mean nareresolba ang problema. Imbis pakinggan ang mga manggagawa, pinapatahimik lang sila. Walang nakikinig. 

So considering na naging system na po natin ang pag set aside sa mga marginalized at ang pagpinta sa mga aktibista/rallyista bilang villains, if elected, do you have any particular planned approach as to how you would deal with rallyists? If yes, ano po yun? And in addition to this, I would also like to ask po what you and the rest of the candidates of PLM plan on doing to put an end to the oppression of our indigenous peoples? Thanks, Atty!",1,2022-03-08 11:43:18

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society.

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

To get to know more about me, here is my [one page profile](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1499242488745570305) and [overview of my platform](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1485099222928338946).

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society.

This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

1. What made you decide to become a labor lawyer? I mean we all know that there are other fields of law, that you can earn thousands of money but why did you choose to protect the rights of our ordinary workers. What is your inspiration in becoming a labor lawyer

Thank you for giving the time to answer..I am hoping you win this election. We need someone who will represent the plight of our workers in the Senate.",1,2022-03-08 13:41:03

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

To get to know more about me, here is my [one page profile](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1499242488745570305) and [overview of my platform](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1485099222928338946).

Gusto ko pa sana magpakalalim sa debateng iyon, kasi ayokong i-dismiss na personahe lang ni Marcos ang inaatake natin. Iyon ang linya nila Gadon na ginamit ko lang ang debates para sirain si Marcos. Yung gusto ko talaga ay mapaliwanag nang mas mahaba kung bakit hindi maaaring pinapangalandakan bilang ‚ÄúGolden Age‚Äù ang Marcos regime.   


To the second part of your question, yes and no. I knew that the conditions were there for millions of others to respond positively to exposing Gadon and Roque. I did not that I will be the one to do it in that moment.",1299,2022-03-08 11:11:38

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

The plight of our farmers is among the top priorities of our party. While we have various proposed laws regarding the agricultural sector, our top priority is to immediately push for the repeal of the 2019 Rice Tariffication Law. This law is responsible for contributing to the destruction of our agricultural sector and domestic food security. It makes us more vulnerable to volatilities in the global rice market which threaten a food staple central to the Filipino family.  

To address the roots of agricultural stagnation and poverty, we will ensure that a new agrarian reform law will be passed, which will immediately complete the distribution of 700,000 undistributed hectares of land, especially the 450,000 hectares of arable farmland. Of course, gaps in previous agrarian reform measures must be addressed. Elite capture and land conversions by agribusiness firms must be prevented and reversed.

As for disaster resilience, it is important to consult experts especially since infrastructure in this arena may necessitate higher initial investments. We must also ensure that the participation and welfare of communities as well as environmental preservation are prioritized. Measures for disaster resilience, however necessary and urgent, must be complemented by systemic efforts towards disaster mitigation and arresting climate-related impacts through a full shift to renewable energy.",71,2022-03-08 13:02:43

The Department of Energy (DOE) itself has reported that the energy sector accounts for 51.7% of all GHG emissions in the country. A complete phaseout of fossil-fuel energy is long overdue.
 
Addressing the need to protect the tenure and livelihood of transport workers, or any other workers in transitioning industries for that matter, can be done by (1) penalizing large GHG emitters (ie. amendments in the Clean Air Act) and (2) government providing ample subsidy and support for workers. It‚Äôs quite that simple - why would you put the burden of the transition on the shoulders of the poor when ang largest GHG emitters ay yung mga mayayaman.
 
Gusto ko lang rin sabihin na a clean transition of the transport sector is incomplete without a clean transition of the energy system. Clean transport will still need to connect to the grid kung saan 51.9% ng buong energy mix ay coal. Kaya alongside a just transition for workers in the transport sector, dapat full coal phaseout and renewable energy development by 2030.

The climate crisis is a very real issue and these two senators are lifelong environmental activists who‚Äôve devoted their lives to organizing communities and fighting for climate justice.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society.

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

Thank you for having me here tonight. I'll be answering until 9:00PM (with a short break from 8:10-8:40 for a media appearance). Hope I can get to most of your questions, if not, my team will try to compile them so we can answer at a later date.

To get to know more about me, here is my [one page profile](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1499242488745570305) and [overview of my platform](https://twitter.com/LukeEspirituPH/status/1485099222928338946).

How will you address this sir? And also, do your proposal only focus on Filipinos and their families? Are foreigners exempt? It might lead to foreign companies having more market share while paying lesser taxes as compared to native companies, especially with the new foreign ownership law.",55,2022-03-08 12:44:39

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

I suggest it as a read pa din, cos mas masarap iabsorb yung main text kesa sa mga detailed explanations by other authors.

Hello everyone. This was fun, and I appreciated the questions. I am a bit tired, so I'll be calling it a night.

I hope this exercise was useful for all of you to get to know me and my positions a bit more. Before I leave, please consider reading more about my legislative platform, linked in the original post. This is a reflection of the broader party platform of Partido Lakas ng Masa. It is a platform that puts forward a comprehensive approach to addressing the problems of our nation. It is a platform borne from the experience of decades of mass struggle by workers, farmers, teachers, students, environmentalists, women, and other sectors of our society. It is the platform that I, David D'Angelo, Roy Cabonegro, #123 PLM Partylist, Walden Bello, and Ka Leody De Guzman believe in and will fight for. Ito ang alternatibong bitbit namin sa eleksyon na ito.

Good night!

The birth rate (along with mortality and migration rates) is used to calculate population growth. The estimated average population may be taken as the mid-year population.

We actually have enough resources in the world to provide the needs of everyone. Biggest problem that exists is inequality. 

Housing can be solved if we redistribute unused land owned by rich people. The food crisis can be averted if we stop converting viable farmland into malls and focused on sustainable practices. 

Plus, fertility rates around the world are going down, and people are having fewer children. Heck in the Philippines the population growth is declining.

 >A rainbow table is an efficient way to store data that has been computed in advance to facilitate cracking passwords. To protect stored passwords from compromise in case of a data breach, organizations avoid storing them directly, instead transforming them using a scrambling function ‚Äì typically a cryptographic hash. One line of attack against this protection is to  precompute the hashes of likely or possible passwords, and then store them in a dataset. However, such a dataset can become too big as the range of possible passwords grows.

These are obviously inherently inaccurate, since they're collected manually, including always having miscounts, not to mention data collection is hard in many places, and also censuses take some amount of time to produce and the population changes over that time, so they're immediately out of date whenever they're published. But for the most part, they're good enough, even in poor countries. Not to mention, you have a never-ending mortality and birth rate, and with immigration and emigration, those rates reduce those figures on a global scale when calculated. For most developed countries there's more than likely a +/- 2-3% discrepancy, and on a global scale, this affects these figures in the hundreds of millions, do you not see how ""approximation"" is straight up, wrong?


>Don't use ""approximate"" if you're going to bring up statistics, when even those same statistics you use as an argument are completely off and done for entertainment purposes. Even an ""approximation"" we would be potentially several million, to a hundreds of millions off. The ""symbolic"" part as well, is for entertainment.

A few days ago, this sub is full of posts about people no longer wanting to help out during calamities and the likes. Kasi nga the government should be doing its work, and hindi na dapat sinasalo ng ordinaryong Pilipino ang responsibilidad.

Pero ngayon, dahil NGO na ang Angat Buhay, marami na ulit gusto mag volunteer. Hindi daw mamimili ng tutulungan. So pag may sakuna at palpak ang gobyerno sa response, NGOs like Angat Buhay will step up to help.

Akala ko ba ang gusto natin eh maipa-mukha sa taong bayan kung gano ka-incompetent ng gobyernong ibinoto nila? Papano mangyayari yun kung laging sasaluhin ang kapalpakan ng gobyerno?

They already hate Leni. Despite all the initiatives she did during the pandemic, her presence during calamities, etc. they believed she didn‚Äôt do anything the last 6 years as VP. You think this NGO will improve their views on her?

May mga nakita na ko na nagsasabing ‚Äúpampabango‚Äù niya lang daw yan for the next elections. They‚Äôll probably grab credits for whatever the NGO accomplishes.

Combatting misinformation is a must, but the question is how? Why weren‚Äôt we successful during the campaign period? What difference are we going to do now? House to house didn‚Äôt work. Tiktok videos didn‚Äôt work either. So how are we gonna combat it? Isa pa, people are not gonna buy it kasi they see us as biased against Marcos, which is true. They see Marcos as the victim of slander, so whatever fact-checking we do is not gonna be effective kasi sa tingin nila eh biased tayo.

Sorry to be a downer here, hindi lang ako fully onboard for now. I‚Äôll maintain my position na hindi ako mag-vovolunteer or mag dodonate for now. I don‚Äôt want my efforts to go to people who don‚Äôt really deserve it.",1,2022-05-13 21:58:14

We failed ""once"" and now we and more importantly, she should give up?


To be fair with 88m, he failed twice to be vp. But he is a tenacious SOB, and as they say, ang kalaban ng magaling ay ang masipag. 88m planned and executed this win for several years, eto lang finocus nya.

She was in a horrible position when vp, being constantly attacked by the administration itself, rampant disinformation, a fragmented opposition towards the admin. Despite all that, she still gained 14M+ voters. All the other candidates didnt come close to what she got and the things she accomplished. She did extremely well despite the challenges.

Im pretty sure that she and her team are on overtime trying to learn from what didnt work and are building new ways to get things done. Learn, adapt, overcome. Nanalo nga yung sinungaling at magnanakaw, kaya anything is possible.

It may seem that im being overoptimistic but even at the start, i was already expecting baby to win, but i still supported leni because she deserves it.

Dont be too concerned that angat buhay will be able to sufficiently respond to whatever the govt will be lacking, there are so many other NGOs that are much better funded and established, and despite all the support, its still not enough and the govt is still going to fuck things up. Angat buhay will be a center for her supporters and to launch and manage her social development programs and calamity responses, its still a good thing no matter what. Tama, a lot of people na matutulungan will probably be the baby supporters but mali nanan kung namimili tayo ng matutulungan, at lalo na ayaw n mam leni ng ganyang style. Our people may not deserve the support but she does at gusto man natin baguhin yung iba, baguhin muna natin ang sarili diba.

The positive aspects of the Philippines included the generally friendly people, the scenery and the climate.

But I realised pretty quickly that the 'low' cost of living was a fallacy: yes, it's cheap if you're a Westerner on holiday. Spending 50 dollars a day or more is nothing. But looking at the average salary of a worker in the Philippines, or the profit margin on goods and services, it becomes apparent that its quite an expensive country.

The other negative aspects involve the general graft that goes on with everyone wanting their cut, whether it's an official granting a health or fire certificate for an establishment, or a taxi driver wildly overcharging. I noticed that the foreigners most likely to succeed were those who had Philippines in-laws with good connections - that rules me out.

And the political instability - seriously, is there a possibility that another Marcos could become leader? Or even worse will it become a colony of China one day?

The above might sound very negative, and I apologise if it does. The Philippines has many positive things going for it - mainly its people. They deserve better, and I hope that will happen one day.

* Lifestyle-  life in the west is too stressful. There's no sense of community like in the PH. It's very hard to make new friends when you're older
* Loneliness - when you're old in the west, you become invisible. Dating prospects are none existent. Many reside in retirement homes and are abandoned by their family
* Expenses - their retirement income isn't enough to afford a decent lifestyle
* Healthcare - incredibly expensive

Unfortunately, too many foreigners have a paradise-like view of developing countries because they're looking at it from a tourist point of view. Living day-to-day here is a different story. The pollution, the bureaucracy, the poverty, and poor infrastructure will get to them if they aren't prepared going in. Some stay because they decided that the positives outweigh the negatives.

That's why it's easier for them to move here and enjoy the advantages.

That being said, tourism to the Philippines is a drop in the park compared to Vietnam or Thailand. I would say Thailand has better facilities and infrastructure, more variety in Western goods, cheaper accommodation and transportation compared to here (just by virtue of their government supporting the tourism industry). If they didn't make shit complicated with their 90 day visa shit, people would be happier. Plus there's the junta, but in general they don't really inconvenience foreigners.

I'm still considering moving abroad long-term even if I am relatively comfortable here. First of all, I would like to have a powerful passport that I don't have to get and pay visas for. Secondly, I would like to avail of quality universal health care and education for my family. Thirdly, it's nice to live in a less politically backward country, but I understand this will be countered by how racist people will be to immigrants like me.

Right now my options are Canada and Australia, or even NZ. I think they are beautiful countries in their own right, but goddamn it the nightlife leaves something to be desired üòÇ

Somewhere else in the EU would be better, but I would have to learn another language aside from English, plus I don't have any family there. 

The US is not an option for long-term stay because of their atrociously expensive health care, wack politics and Christian fundamentalism. Still great to visit, though. Most of the guys are circumcised, just like Pinoys! 

That being said I am able to choose the country not because I need to work there but because of other living considerations, and this is a privilege in itself that not many Filipinos have.

Context- took him years to be able to migrate here in the US, he is 2 years into living here living in SF where everything is expensive.

Me- I have some privileges through my parents so moving here for me was easy but I also had to work my way up to be able to survive here because California is just hella expensive.

I have a financial plan, I also have my family home in Manila I can live at. I can live frugally if the time comes, I just need some base savings. 
And the fact I lived in the PH, means I understand how hard and how to navigate myself back home. And its not like Im ""retiring"" there yetr. I plan to work, I have family matters to attend to, etc...

My friend is annoyed Im moving back. TBH I wanna scream its none of their business. He is lowkey annoyed Im throwing away the fact I have citizenship.

I shut down his comment the other day. I told him Im not happy here. I grind each day, come home to a empty house, my med bills here with insurance is expensive and I got more into debt here than savings. Worst I have no family here. Im miserable.
He does not get it.  So i said in the end Ill do what makes me at peace.

When a foreigner tells me they plan to move to the PH, I warn them that its not easy as it looks. You need a plan and I always suggest to test it for half a year before making a lifelong commitment.

I can tell you that I fell in love with the country and its people immediately upon visiting and can't wait to get back there.  I don't know if I would go there to live permanently, but I would like to spend a good several months there at least.  I visited Palawan and Cebu.  Highlights for me were Port Barton island hopping and Bantayan Island north of Cebu.

From my perspective, I really enjoyed the happy, helpful people and the beautiful, natural  scenery.  Also helpful was the fact that the citizens there mostly speak enough English so that I can continue to be a lazy American and not have to learn much Tagalog or another of the many languages spoken there.

I think we as humans always have a desire for things that we don't currently have.  This may be financial freedom provided by OFW working for Filipinos, or outsiders looking to experience the Philippine lifestyle, culture, scenery, people, etc that we can not experience in our home country.

But honestly, to each their own. However when I got to live abroad for more than a year, I just realised the difference in terms of wages. Some progressive countries provide a living wage where it‚Äôs easier to afford basic needs - food, shelter, clothing, car without working your ass off 24/7. But here in the Philippines, even if you graduated many times and with titles on your name, you still basically can‚Äôt afford a decent place of your own, what more a car. Hard labors are also paid well in other countries while here they are paid with minimum wage per DAY and not by hour. That‚Äôs not to say that living abroad is easy, of course everything comes with a little bit of sacrifice and challenges here and there. Anyway, I have just been thinking of working in other countries than here. Someone dear to me will now be working overseas to pursue his passion and it‚Äôs just aww I wanna come with you kinda thing lol.

For them, their savings and pensions multiply because the cost of living is affordable. But the misconception is if you want to live a life like in a developed country a foreigner must pay more for those conveniences here in the Philippines. Imported products cost more here. For most Filipinos, these are luxuries that are enjoyed cheaply in developed countries. This explains why Overseas Working Filipinos (OFWs) send Balikbayan boxes back home to their family. Filipinos leave the Philippines because of the lack of career opportunities and the ability to upgrade their living status. If you talk to Filipinos working overseas about their recent vacation. They will mention that their families are OK living on the remittances sent. But the underlying fact most Filipinos talk about is the little change and progress of the Philippine nation. Specifically in the topics of a fair and functioning government, competitiveness, and response to domestic and foreign affairs.

*(The irony that the image reflects is true. While many foreigners aged move to the Philippines many professionals, such as nurses leave the country.) For example, if old foreigners move to the Philippines and nurses leave the country that poses a problem to the general healthcare system.

I know it sounds obvious, but it's one of those things that you have to experience first hand to understand.

A life of luxury is impossible for most people in North America, here it's attainable for 1/5th the price. If you can even find an online job that pays you $15/hour (minimum wage abroad), you could be making PHP1.5-2M a year and living a decent life here. In most US cities, making that much barely affords you a life. Most people are drowning in credit card debt or bank and student loans. It took me 9 years to pay off my student loans, it took my parents 15 years to pay off their mortgage. People have things but they mostly live on borrowed time. It's not as grand as it looks.

It'll take too long to explain, but having lived in the BGC/Makati CBD area for more than 10 years, my quality of life is not that much different and in fact, is better in a LOT of ways here. It helps that I chose a profession that allows me to get jobs and get paid the same amount wherever I live.

I understand it's not as common, and perhaps not as accessible to most Filipinos but I'm sharing this to offer you a different perspective. There are a lot of people like me who are able to live a decent, some would say extremely comfortable, life, here in this country. I understand it's bad (REALLY BAD) for a lot of people here, but there are reasons why foreigners choose to live and have a decent to amazing quality of life here.

IMO it's a false/naive notion that PH is great & cheap. 

PH and many SEA countries are cheap if you have lots of money in the bank, realistically enough to reach you for retirement. Otherwise, like the person above said... It's ""cheap"" to live here. 

Good luck living as a foreigner in PH without family and no proper social security. You're pretty much on your own here when shit hits the fan (I speak from experience a few years ago). 

If you're in any random European country, or even the US, no matter what happens to you, you're likely protected in some way with really good social security. 

It's much better for long-term stability to live in other countries. E. g. my friend and his Filipina GF moved to Sweden, his home country, kasi there's so many benefits for them in terms of raising a family.

Property is much cheaper in the provinces, but then again, you're out in the provinces where goods and services are much harder to come by, hence, increasing the cost of purchase in transport and logistics expenses. Something goes wrong out there and you need a tubero? Haha. Have fun with that.

Supermarket prices in Rustan's and Shopwise are on par with Western countries. Beer is cheap if you stick to San Miguel. Imports are pricey. Dining out in a good restaurant is slightly cheaper, but the quality is not very exciting.

Computers, televisions, appliances...more expensive and shit quality.

We live in Makati near the CBD. What I pay in rent wouldn't cover a studio in San Francisco. But even in our relatively high-brow complex, everything is fucking shit.

If you are still under a work visa, you cannot avail of any benefits if something happens to you. Just NHS. But no unemployment, no universal credit, etc. This was a big issue last year here in the UK during COVID as a lot of nurses had family who (who were not nurses) got so sick and couldn't  work and could not avail of benefits as it was not allowed. 

Also, I agree with the other poster, as someone working in the NHS, there is some sort of slave labor . Filipino nurses are given more patients, sicker, heavier and difficult patients compared to their white counter parts. They know that we work hard so they give it to us. If we complain, it is not taken seriously. 

Average salary in the NHS may say 27k + 3k if you search google, but in reality, it is just 22k with no additional 3k if you work outside London.

My point is, a lot of Filipinos choose to go to the States for their children and future children because this secures them of quality education until college. Moreover, this secures them that they will have no difficulties obtaining a job there. Just imagine all the hardships of the immigrants who are trying to get in the country for the children just for them to not have a hard time as they grow up. I, myself, am trying to go to the States as a doctor. The earliest I could obtain a green card is when I‚Äôm 37 years old.

7508,hh7kgvg,Philippines,"Wait, why are you guys moving in?",,Congressive,"The 'foreigner treatment' has two edges, neither completely smooth.

Yes, there's a certain amount of deference in certain situations‚Äîbecause you're a foreigner, you're automatically ""rich"", which is a remnant of the colonial mindset you mention. Most people won't cut in front of a foreigner at the bank‚Äîmost. Locals see you coming and something registers‚Äîwhat that something turns out to be is somewhat variable.

By local standards, I'm loaded‚Äîfor sure. I'm even doing well by US West Coast standards. But what many don't understand is the massive differences between rich, generous, and stupid. My wife hates my generosity. It's bad for the economy. But I'm not fucking stupid. Having money doesn't make me special or beg for any special treatment. I never understood what people think they're going to get out of me by being so nice? An extra 100 peso tip?

On the other hand, you're a target. Taxi drivers will try to charge more. Store clerks won't avail of the Pinoy discount. Unless you haggle, you're paying full price, sometimes the 'foreigner price'. If you look like a tourist, the scammers will be on you like bad breath. AND there are a number of people, especially upper class Pinoys, who absolutely detest foreigners. That's because they think we're all a bunch of sexpats.

Finally, the very last thing you want is to have any sort of interaction with the police. God help you if you're flying solo without a Pinay wife. You're screwed.

I've been here so long that I can say ""nowadays"", so nowadays, the meaning of 'foreigner' has two levels: there are whiteys like me and there are Chinese/Indian/East Asian foreigners. Their playing field looks somewhat different.

One of my neighbors is from China. We've only exchanged ""hello"" several times. He doesn't know that I speak Mandarin. He speaks maybe three words of English. Anyway, the second time we crossed paths, we exchanged pleasantries and I walked toward my unit. His wife came out of the rental unit and said in Chinese, ""Who are you talking to?"" and he said, ""The foreigner (waiguoren).""

It just made me laugh. A Chinese guy calling me a foreigner in the Philippines.

But my point is, the ACA law put a cap on the out of pocket which shields people with insurance from paying the $1M bill because once you meet you max out of pocket, your insurance is legally required to foot 100% of the bill

About two years ago, I visited my lola in California. During that trip, nagdevelop ako nag pigsa at lumala. It got worse enough na kailangan na ako dalin sa emergency room (during my last night). Nilagay ako sa CAT scan, binigyan ng pampatulog, at drain yun mga nana na nasa binti ko. Gusto nga ng mga doctor dun na mag admit pa ako sa hospital (sa US) for ten days, as life threatening yun sugat ko. From hearing all those horror stories about getting a five-digit bill (in dollars), I decided to just risk it. Go back to my lola's house, pack my shit, and take the flight home.

As soon as I got off NAIA, diretso na agad ako sa hospital sa Bulacan. Nag stay ako ng one week (may aircon yun room) dun. Sinaksakan ako ng anti-biotics, kung meron pa, drain nila yun naititrang pigsa, linisin, at gamotin yun sugat ko.

Lahat lahat (gamot, kwarto, doctor. procedure), 100K lang binayaran. (around $2,000). One week later, dumating yun bill ko sa hospital sa US, at $18,000 (almost 1m sa atin) ang singil sa akin, just at the emergency room. If I were to stay in the hospital in the US, baka umabot pa ng $100,000 (5 million sa atin).",39,2021-10-19 12:03:33

*question:*

I really wanna convince my parents and grandparents to vote for Leni, but I'm scared! DDS sila (also very persistent and stubborn), and ang arguments nila to voting Marcos is so insane (buti pa daw ng Martial Law maayos ang tao) that I just want to shake the Apologists out of them, haha.

They also watch YouTube videos that advocates them to be a DDS. I've heard the videos, and it's just repeated phrases and sources that are not credible. No educated arguments to be found.

Kanina rin, I though they actually changed their minds and vote for Leni. But in reality, they just mocked Leni for changing colors, and stated that her VP is Kris Aquino. I told them, ""Who said that Kris Aquino was Leni's VP?"" Tinuro nila yung vid kung saan galing. Again, it's a freaking source that's not credible again. *hayst*

If I send them links, pictures, and files of Leni's credentials, platforms, or advocacies, they will most probably not read them. They'll just say ""Leni Lugaw siya!"" or ""Delawan ka ba?"" 

I'm scared that they might kick me out of the house and never speak to me again. 

**How? I need help!**

Don't get me wrong, I love my parents and grandparents dearly. They're the reason that my mental health is the best there is. They also give great advice in other aspects of life. It's just that one thing, and I hope that one thing won't be the breaking point in the future.",5,2021-10-07 08:54:46

I know lumalabas kasi counterbalance or keeping in check of a corrupt President yung Vice (like Leni has done) but we‚Äôve seen a ambitious VP (Yung may braces) plot and did get the President (yung lasingero) evicted. I propose President (with a VP of his choosing or a cabinet designed as VP) be elected but also that the Ombudsman be directly elected and separated from the executive.

But let's see.

Btw, Twitter feels more like 95% Robredo country due to the worldwide trends after she announced. And Facebook for me feels 90% Leni, but that's probably the algorithm and because my FB friends are mostly from Bicol and we love the Robredos for what they've done here.",2,2021-10-07 17:54:30

\>delivered PPEs to hospitals

\>food and care packages for frontliners and their families

\>provided a job for people for making a PPE and then donates it to hospitals

I can also add more. She hosted an hospital-relay program for people with possible CoVID-19 symptoms. My mother volunteered for a while in this.

Before that as well, she also hosted various donation programs across the country.

Also, she is awarded by the COA with the highest audit rating for three years. Basically, there is no trace of corruption.

She did this all with a limited budget.

There are still lots more that I failed to include. But she is the best candidate in this election,

Kung, halimabwa lang, ang first choice mo ba is si Leody tapos close 2nd mo si Leni - pareho mong pinaniniwalaan na magiging mabuti silang presidente - pero lets face it, mababa ang winnability ni Leody, will you vote for your best choice na halos walang pagasa manalo? Or yung lesser choice mo pero may fighting chance?


Sure you may say si Leody, but you would be lying if you said it was a vote because you believe in that vote being the best move you could make for the country and not a vote totally based on principle / idealism.


Every vote counts, but one vote doesn't turn the tide. For that to happen there has to be a massive shift in sentiment and ideology, and that's not something that happens on election day but in the lead up to the elections (ideally even way before). So hopefully that happens. I don't know how, considering the massive gains in support and sympathy that the Duterte camp and especially the Marcos camps have gained through the years, but hopefully it does.",108,2021-10-07 04:04:49

FIRST OF ALL, OPPOSITION IS WEAK. malakas pa rin ang suporta ng mga tao kay duterte, idagdag mo pa ang mga marcos loyalists

Kung opposition votes lang ang aaasahan natin, mga around 6-7 million lang ito. Trust me yan lang ang makukuhang boto ni leni sa 2022. 


Kaya nga kailangan ang suportahan natin ay ang kandidato na nasa Gitna, hindi masyadong anti, hindi rin pro duterte. Para makuha natin ang mga alternative/neutral votes. Pati na rin ang mga ex DDS na kahit dismayado kay duterte eh ayaw parin bumoto ng dilaw. 

Ang problema kasi sa inyo, ayaw nyong mag compromise. Andami nyong ayaw na kandidato. 

Dapat as long as its not marcos or duterte, you should be fine with it. It does not matter kung ex DDS yan or enabler yan. Kung itong tao nato ang makakatalo kay bong bong, dapat siya ang suportahan natin.

There are still a lot of people (probably more than half of the population) in this country who are swayed by people's reputations/familiarity and whatnot than what the candidate has to offer. 

I don't think that Leni is an ideal president but she's closer to that than the others. At least she is not as questionable as everyone else. I highly believe that all she needs is a better publicity and has to be firm about her views towards the country's international safety (China) and she'll have a great shot at winning.",0,2021-10-08 02:01:16

Because she cannot acknowledge the mistakes they did when they were in power that damaged their party.

>She has expressed her lack of ambitions of the position but Isko and Manny has clearly not agreed with her principles hence why the talks never naterialized. My guess is neither Pacquiao nor Isko were willing to go after Duterte after the elections.

Any source on this? Also going back to my original question if the goal is to beat Duterte/Marcos why is the frontrunner supposed to be the one adjusting to the so-called principles of the laggard? Furthermore if she doesn't have any ambitions why is she running to begin with? Frankly if Sara doesn't run she just handed the election to BBM.",1,2021-10-08 04:33:56

Google had it right (but wrong) - right in that he was using a mixture of Filipino/Tagalog and English words (hence Taglish), but wrong coz ‚Äúkatabi‚Äù is ‚Äúbeside‚Äù in English (‚Äúdoor‚Äù is pinto or pintuan in Tagalog). And we do mix Tagalog-English words in everyday conversation, somewhat automatically (at least for me).",19,2023-01-20 15:22:52
9148,j59e1vi,Philippines,CS Days!,,SovietMarma,"English is the 2nd language of the Philippines. It's taught in schools starting from Kindergarten. I'd say it's also commonplace to find Filipinos that speak ""Taglish"" on the internet.  


And personally, I think it's an unconscious decision. I naturally switch between English and Tagalog fairly often when I talk with my peers.",5,2023-01-21 09:37:11
