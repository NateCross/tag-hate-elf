Then in 2016 Pacquiao made a remark against gays and lesbians calling them ""worse than animals"" with matching bible verse.

We should all live our lives by being the best people we can and tolerant of all other people and their choices in life (within reason, not things like rape, murder, etc.) and that's all there is to it. Plain and simple disliking someone because they are gay is the dumbest thing ever and if you really believe in the bible and God then you are committing a sin right there by judging them and you are not supposed to do that, but again people use religion to condemn things they don't like and these people don't apply it to themselves and what they do.",1,2023-01-06 07:55:18

Pacquiao is blunt, but his words are not only reserved for certain groups. Judgement for our sins awaits ALL of us.

Thankfully He has given grace in the form of faith to us through the cross of calvary.

The actual terminology used is translated as ""a man bedding a boy"" so in today's society our word would be ""pedophilia"". Then there's the context, most of the rules were written to stop those who were supposed to be following Judaism from being influenced by the cultural environment they were in at the time (i.e. Greek, Roman, Persian, Egyptian, etc.). 

These stains have just weaponized the texts to reflect their agenda and justify the reasoning behind being foul creatures of pettiness, spite, and hate. There's no excuse for it anymore, it's always been bigotry and it is time to show that there is no place for this mentality in an advancing society. It's time to leave the bigots in the past that they so covet and move on without them. This is not something we can be bipartisan about, there's no agreement to come to. They are evil end of story.


Edit: some people are saying the stigmatizism towards homosexuals was always around but I never said the people never had an issue with it. I said the diety never had an issue with it and you absolutely cannot prove he did!! We are talking about words these unstable individuals were hearing spoken by an invisible fairy in their heads!! That is a massive mental well-being red flag!!

The fluidity of this religions arguments were enough to make me realize how fake it is. Look at how they treat women. You have them saying women cannot be leaders yet you have Aquila and Priscilla leading in the early churches. The passages the criticize female leadership were taken wildly out of context to fit an agenda and used to control a population. Oh and revelations already happened so there will be no silly rapture the context that this is referring to is Titus destroying Jerusalem in 70 CE",57,2023-01-06 14:41:36

Bautista was interviewed recently by GQ in connection with the buzz surrounding his role in Glass Onion.

Bautista's remarks about the tattoo and Pacquiao was part of that interview.

It happened in 2016, but Bautista didn't speak about it at the time.

It's being posted now, because it's new information that only surfaced now.

It's not a case of _""we already knew that Bautista had this tattoo and we already knew that he had it covered up in response to Pacquiao's remarks and it's being surfaced again out of nowhere just to slam Pacquiao""_ - it's genuinely fresh information, even if it happened six years ago, and whether or not Pacquiao has changed his views on the LGBT community since 2016 is irrelevant to Bautista's reasons for doing something in 2016.",58,2023-01-06 05:53:48

Given the context of the rest of the Book of Leviticus and that there was not really a distinction between civil law and religious law at the time, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much of a stretch to argue that Leviticus discourages homosexuality for hygienic reasons, not moral ones, at a time when they didn‚Äôt have the clearest understanding of STDs (or, like, access to modern plumbing).

Some temples allowed prostitution as a form of worship. There are even examples of Greek families prostituting their children to curry favor with political and religious leaders.

If you want to go down the route then explain the paradox of an omnipotent, all-knowing being and free will. You can't claim to be omnipotent but be incredibly controlling to the point you cull entire civilizations for being different. How can a God who claims to be love be the source of such destruction and wrath? Explain the Gnostic Gospels and the catholic churches effort to scrub them from history because they show that Judaism had multiple gods like everyone else. 

To say religion is not propaganda is a lie. It could be used to do good but it is used for evil and oppression. Any human with a moral conscious sees this hence the mass exodus of religion in today's society. I, personally, cannot phathom condemning a people because of their actions with consenting adults just because I don't participate.

The use of the verb ""reveals"" implied that it was new information.

I will grant that the OP took a screenshot of a tweet, instead of linking to the tweet directly, but if you actually did want to dig into this issue, it would have made sense to, for example:

* notice that the screenshot indicates a link to an article on people.com
* google a search string such as ""people.com dave bautista pacquiao""
* follow the search result that goes to people.com, which would bring you to this article: [Dave Bautista Covered Manny Pacquiao Tattoo After Homophobic Statement: 'It's a Personal Issue'](https://people.com/style/dave-bautista-covered-manny-pacquiao-tattoo-after-homophobic-statement/)

The article is dated January 5, 2023, and says:

> Although he did not mention his former friend by name, the Glass Onion star, 53, revealed to GQ that he had a tattoo of Filipino boxing champ Manny Pacquiao's team logo removed from his left forearm.

And the article also links to a tiktok, posted by GQ, as a snippet of that interview (though not in reference to the specific remarks about Pacquiao).

\___

> With that in mind, was my wondering if there was a new development on this issue such a big deal?

Your phrasing made it sound like any change-of-mind that Pacquiao might have had since 2016 somehow delegitimizes Bautista doing what he did beforehand.

Batista was a true wrestler (olympic style wrestling) and a purple belt Jiu-jitsu practitioner. Which was why he entered MMA in his 40s after his WWE stint.

Wrestling is an ancient martial art practiced by Romans, Greeks, Persians, Chinese, Mongols, Ottoman warriors. Different variations of wrestling became the base of certain modern grappling arts like Judo, then Judo became the base of Sambo and Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.

If the scripted combat in WWE is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word wrestling then shame on you. Ignorance is bliss.
 
You will realize that wrestling is an efficient form of combat because once you get thrown by a Wrestler via suplex, or a Judoka's Uchi-Mata on a rock hard pavement. It's enough for you to sustain lethal injuries and concussions. Moreso if they apply submission locks leaving you with broken limbs. They can even instantly kill you with choking techniques.",0,2023-01-06 10:36:51
461,j36x55k,Philippines,David Bautista Covered Manny Pacquiao Tattoo After Homophobic Statement,,YunaKinoshita,"Nope! Styles make fights. I practice Judo and Muay Thai myself.

Why do you think boxers clinch each other? That's to prevent the opponent from throwing a punch. In the eyes of a casual observer they just call it hugging but a simple tactic such as clinching is an effective tool to render one's boxing useless. What more if it was an actual grappling technique complete with grabs, throws, sweeps, submissions?

Why do you think grappling have become an essential discipline in MMA? If you compete in MMA with just striking alone you'll get destroyed by any decent grappler.

In a strategic and tactical perspective. If Batista leverages his experience in Olympic Style Wrestling plus his knowledge in Jiu-jitsu as a Purple Belt. Pacquiao's Boxing is no match no matter how great he was. 

Look for the fight between Muhamad Ali(All Time Greatest Boxer) vs Inoki (Wrestler). Even with special rules where Inoki couldn't use the full extent of his wrestling abilities. The fight resulted into a draw since Ali despite his mobility, speed, and power couldn't hurt Inoki who was mostly staying low on the ground where Ali couldn't reach him with his punches. On the other hand Inoki was banned to use takedowns. Therefore it became a stalemate.

Another example was James Toney(IBF middleweight and cruiserweight boxing champion) vs Randy Couture (NCAA Division I Greco Roman Wrestling Champion, UFC champion) Immediately after the bell he shoot for a takedown, pinned and submitted James Toney.",0,2023-01-06 13:40:02
