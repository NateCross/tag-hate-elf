    "\n",
    "First, BERT takes a sentence and chops it up into smaller pieces called \"tokens.\" It's like BERT is using scissors to cut the sentence into bite-sized chunks that it can easily munch on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "Next, BERT gives a special code to each token. This code is like a name tag that helps BERT remember what each token means and how it relates to the other tokens in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- \"BERT\" -> code 1\n",
    "- \"is\" -> code 2\n",
    "- \"cool\" -> code 3\n",

    "- \"BERT is cool!\" -> BERT understands that \"BERT\" is the subject, \"is\" is the verb, and \"cool\" is describing BERT."

    "Example:\n",
    "- Layer 1: BERT thinks, \"Hmm, 'BERT' and 'cool' seem to be related.\"\n",

BERT uses its language skills to tackle these challenges.\n",

    "## How does BERT work?\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT works by breaking down sentences into smaller pieces called tokens. It then tries to understand the meaning and context of each token and how they relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like BERT is solving a puzzle, where each token is a piece of the puzzle, and BERT's job is to put the pieces together to see the bigger picture – the meaning of the entire sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, BERT uses a lot of fancy math and computer science techniques, but you don't need to worry about that. Just know that BERT is really good at understanding language!"

    "## What can BERT do?\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is like a language swiss-army knife – it can help with all sorts of language tasks! Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sentiment Analysis: BERT can figure out if a piece of text, like a movie review, is positive or negative.\n",
    "   - Example: \"This movie was amazing!\" → BERT says it's a positive review!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Question Answering: BERT can answer questions based on a given text.\n",
    "   - Example: \"What color was the cat?\" (text: \"The cat was black and white.\") → BERT answers: \"black and white\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Named Entity Recognition: BERT can find and label important things in a sentence, like names of people, places, or companies.\n",
    "   - Example: \"John works at Microsoft in New York.\" → BERT labels \"John\" as a person, \"Microsoft\" as a company, and \"New York\" as a place!\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's just the tip of the iceberg! BERT can do a lot more cool things with language."

    "\n",
    "BERT is important because it helps computers understand human language better. This means that we can create smarter language-based applications and tools that can assist us in our daily lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine having a smart assistant that can understand your questions and give you accurate answers, or a tool that can automatically summarize long articles for you. BERT makes these things possible!"
